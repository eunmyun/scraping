False RATING False ORIGIN On 15 December 2017 the reaganwasright.com web site published an article reporting that Alabama state police had arrested three polls workers in Birmingham for allegedly allowing thousands of invalid votes to be processed in a hotly-contested special election a race which saw Doug Jones defeat Republican candidate Roy Moore to capture the first U.S. Senate seat for Democrats in Alabama in 25 years: Alabama State Police have arrested three women in Birmingham for allowing more than 3000 invalid votes for Doug Jones to processed through the polling station they had volunteered to operate. The State Attorneys Division of Integrity in Elections is calling the acts of the women a blatant disregard for the duties of civil servants a violation of the public trust and a 2nd-degree felony. Wanda Werkmeister Olivia Pertuiary and Maureen Brown will all face charges of conspiracy to contribute to widespread voter fraud and violation of the public trust both punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a million dollars in fines. Roy Moores campaign on the news that voter fraud was rampant in Birmingham and all of Applevale County is standing by at the door of the clerks office to the 17th District Federal Court of Appeals to file an injunction against a single vote from the Democrat stronghold to be counted.

Anger is growing among U.S Citizens. They are outraged by the recent exposure of the consequences of Muslim immigration. Because as it turns out they have to pay a fortune in social assistance to Syrian immigrants that are living in the United States. We have many cases in Europe too! In Denmark where a Syrian man with 3 wives and 20 kids gets DKK 214000 in child benefits which caused outrage in Denmark and proposals for changing the law. Ghazia A. (49) was a self-employed cars salesman in Syria where he provided for himself and his large family. But in 2015 he traveled to Germany and that was the end of self- sustaining. In Germany he does not lift a finger. He lives on social welfare paid by German taxpayers. And he does so with his four wives and 22 children. He also has an adult daughter who is married in Saudi Arabia. So it would be interesting to see how much he would earn if he was in the USA and we all know how many cases of Muslims coming into our country and living on welfare! A U.S. economist has calculated how much this family would take from the U.S. Treasury. He reached a figure that it is about $ 360000 a year. Yet vets struggle every day. Not to mention hard working people who live payday to payday. That figure has led many Americans to see red at the fact that they are the ones who must pay the large sum. Money to healthy adults who do not work and even undermines American values with polygamy. In Muslim countries a man is usually allowed to have up to four wives. Ghazia A. is one of the many Muslim men who has used this right in Syria. In the United States and most of the western countries however polygamy is prohibited. But immigration means that there is a growing number of Muslims in the United States who practice polygamy. Ghazia A. admittedly was asked to make one of the four wives his official wife and he chose Twasif with five children as his official wife. The three other women now live three other places with the other 17 children. But in reality his polygamy remains largely unchanged ! Authorities have designated the three other wives as his partners. They also live nearby. And they are all paid by the,CLAIM A Syrian refugee receives close to $400000 in benefits a year from the German government in order to take care of his wives and children. Mostly False RATING Mostly False WHATS TRUE A refugee from Syria with nearly two dozen children and four wives resettled in Germany. WHATS FALSE We found no confirmation supporting the claim that he receives the equivalent of $390000 annually in benefits. ORIGIN In October 2016 several publications drummed up outrage over a Syrian refugee referred to only as Ghazia A. who was reportedly receiving close to $400000 annually in benefits from Germany to support his four wives and nearly two dozen children. Although some outlets published their stories with headlines outright stating that this man was already receiving that amount in benefits (for example: Germany: Muslim Migrant with Four Wives and 23 Children Receives $390000 a Year in Benefits) the number did not come from an official source and was not confirmed by the German government. Some sites did however make note of this lack of confirmation: The family could be receiving more than 320000 a year in benefits according to a financial manager on the Employers Association website. There is no official confirmation on this figure. Rumors about Ghazia A. began with an article published by German newspaper Rhein-Zeitung on 1 August 2016. The newspaper detailed how the man his wives and their children were settled into several different municipalities near Montabaur and noted the difficulties they had adapting to their new communities as well as how internal conflicts developed because only some of the family members could receive social benefits. The claim that Ghazia A. was receiving close to $400000 annually in benefits was derived by a third party who used the mans circumstances to calculate a theoretical number. Financial expert Hubert Knigsstein looked at the mans unique circumstances and estimated the theoretical maximum amount the man could conceivably be receiving based upon that information: It is interesting to note that you can have such a large family in Syria without the state giving anything while in Germany 4000 women and 23 children can receive 30.030 = money (in 360.360 ). Before we go on in the text: interested readers can get the basis for my calculations upon request. Please note that some details are not to be found so that facts and costs were partly estimated according to life experience. In other words Knigsstein estimated how much a man with four wives and 23 children might receive in social benefits in Germany not how much this specific refugee actually received. A municipality spokesperson told German news service Deutsche Welle that this is not how benefits work in Germany: the countrys laws prohibit polygamy and do not allow someone to receive benefits for multiple families. Rather Ghazia A. would have to select one wife and her respective children to be eligible for social assistance. However the rest of his wives could apply for benefits on their own.,,0,0,,

Tom and Janis Morrison a young couple from the small town of Greensboro in Alabama called 911 around 10:00 pm last night to ask for an ambulance. Samantha Irving the operator who took the call says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation. The woman told me that her husband had fallen and that his head was now stuck in her vaginal cavity. I really thought that it was a group of teenagers making a prank call. Despite Ms. Irvings doubts she sent an ambulance on the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious. Bill Austin one of the paramedics who transported the couple claims they were lying naked on their bed and partially covered in blood. The woman kept screaming out in pain whenever the guy moved but he had half of his face buried in there and he looked like he was going through Hell! The couple was transported to the nearby Hale County Hospital where doctors were able to separate the couple. Ms. Morrison suffered from severe internal bleeding but is now stable while her husband has suffered only a few scratches and bruises. According to doctors both could also suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome. Dr. Frank Olson who treated the couple upon their arrival at the hospital says that such extreme sexual practices are extremely dangerous and recommends to completely avoid them. Incidents like this one are indeed quite unusual but hundreds of couples are admitted to the hospital every year in the U.S. after getting stuck together during sexual intercourse. According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 3213 couples were hospitalized for such problems across the country in 2015 and 3789 in 2016.

The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for the last two years insisting she needed breast implants and begging for a surgery. Her mother Dana Manson says she tried to convince Juliet that her breasts would grow with time but her daughter was completely obsessed with the idea of getting breast implants. She would ask us multiple times a day every day she told NBC. There was nothing in the world that she wanted more than having boobs. Ms Manson even consulted a psychiatrist with her daughter hoping to rid Juliet of her obsession. The result however was very different from what she expected. After a dozen sessions with young girl the renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez concluded that she was suffering from a severe depression and had a serious lack of self-esteem and told her mother that a surgery could be beneficial. Doctor Ramirez says the young girl has developed some serious complexes about her appearance over the years and the operation will help her get an improved image of herself. Following the psychiatrists advice Ms Manson contacted dozens on clinics in the United States and Mexico but none of them were willing to perform a breast augmentation surgery on such a young girl. She finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China where doctors were willing to perform the operation. Dana Manson decided that she would go on the trip to Asia with her daughter over the holidays and that the surgery would count as her Christmas present. They left for China on December 22 and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned. The young girl now has a 30C cup and her mother says shes extremely happy about her about her new breasts. Dana Manson told NBC that like every mother in the world she wanted her children to be happy and that Juliet was clearly unhappy about not having any breasts. The young girls story caught the worlds attention after she posted several pictures of herself on her Instagram account only hours after the surgery instantly causing a storm of reactions on the social media. Many people are denouncing the Manson parents for allowing their daughter to undergo plastic surgery at such a young age while others are blaming her psychiatrist for his recommendation. Despite the critics Dana Manson says she did what was best for her daughter and insists that she has no regrets.,CLAIM A 7-year-old girl was flown to China to receive breast implants for her birthday. False RATING False ORIGIN On 7 February 2017 World News Daily Report published a story pushing the claim that a seven-year-old California girl received breast implants after hectoring her mother for two years. According to the story Dana Manson obliged her daughter Juliet after being advised by renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez that the procedure would boost her self-esteem: They left for China on December 22 and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned. The young girl now has a 30C cup and her mother says shes extremely happy about her about her new breasts.

Mixture RATING Mixture WHATS TRUE Rosie ODonnell tweeted an ""offer"" of two million dollars each to Senators Flake and Collins if they voted ""no"" on a GOP tax bill. WHATS FALSE The claim ODonnell broke federal law by posting her tweet is based on a largely superficial and incomplete legal analysis. ORIGIN On 19 December 2017 comedian Rosie ODonnell tweeted an offer of $2 million each to Republican U.S. Senators Jeff Flake and Susan Collins provided they each voted no on the GOP tax reform bill: so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Even though ODonnells offer was rather obviously a hypothetical bit of humor intended to make a point and even though neither Flake nor Collins voted against the bill (which passed both chambers of Congress and was signed into law on 22 December 2017) many on the right used the tweet to suggest that ODonnell a foe of Donald Trumps since well before his presidential run had broken federal bribery laws. Foxs Sean Hannity for example wrote: Rosies offer may land the comedian in hot water with federal authorities as offering funds to public officials to change their votes is considered a serious crime. Conservative Daily Wire editor Ben Shapiro implored Attorney General Jeff Sessions to get cracking on the case saying: Bribery is illegal under federal law. Both Hannity and Shapiro cited 18 U.S.C. 201(b)(1) of the U.S. Code as the relevant statute: (b) Whoever (1) directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity with intent (A) to influence any official act; or (B) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing or collude in or allow any fraud or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud on the United States; or (C) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person; While a cursory reading of the statute may seem like a slam-dunk case against ODonnell it is highly unlikely that such a case would make it very far as the standard of evidence for conviction based on federal jury instructions provided for trials involving violations of 18 U.S.C. 201(b)(1) require proof of what is known as corrupt intent a high legal bar. In more simple terms this would mean that a court would need to prove ODonnell intended the statement as a serious offer and not as some other expression of her own free speech as a comedian as reported by The Hill: For Rosie to be guilty youd have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she was not joking or trolling but actually intending to influence the senators.

False RATING False ORIGIN An image featuring two quotes purportedly uttered by singers Celine Dion and Loretta Lynn concerning their opposing views of the United States of America was circulated on social media in September 2017: I cant even look at an American flag any more I hate this country. Singer Celine Dion. You dont deserve to be American Youre not Patriot Patriots love their country Flag President and People. Singer Loretta Lynn. These quotes are as real as they are grammatically correct which is to say not at all. This rumor originated on a clickbait web site (with an apparent vendetta against Dion) called USADailyNewsPosts.com. The fake Dion quote originally appeared in a 1 September 2017 post that consisted solely of an image of the Canadian singer the inaccurate quote and a question: Over the next 7 days USADailyNewsPosts.com concocted a make believe controversy involving flag burnings talk show appearances America-hating celebrities and patriotic country singers. Loretta Lynn was the first to be dragged into this fictional foray when the web site published an post (again consisting solely of an image and a fake quote) claiming that the country singer had criticized Dion for disrespecting the flag. With ideas in short supply or possibly in an attempt to see if another singer would prove to be a more reliable source of traffic the web site then placed this exact fictional phrase in the mouth of singer Cher: Lynns (or Chers) rebuttal to Dions comment set off a series of imaginary events involving Katy Perry Cyndi Lauper Ellen Degeneres Reba McEntire and President Trump. The following image contains a selection of articles from this fake news series (click to enlarge) and is accompanied by our attempt to summarize this bizarre fantasy: Summary: Celine Dion insults the American flag. Loretta Lynn (or Cher) calls her unpatriotic. This leads to Dion burning the American flag on stage. At this point the web site takes a poll to see if readers would support President Trump if he decided to deport Dion. This causes Katy Perry to voice her support of Dion while the Canadian singer expresses remorse. It doesnt last long however as Dion goes onto the Ellen Degeneres show to burn another flag. Cyndi Lauper joins team flag burner and Reba McEntire joins the anti-Dions. The Canadian singer is again threatened with deportation but instead of apologizing Dion calls Donald Trump sexist. The last entry (at the time of this writing) showcases a fake quote from Cher in which she tells Dion to go back to Canada. Coincidentally it is the same quote that Reba McEntire allegedly said a few articles prior. A feud of this magnitude would certainly warrant coverage by newspapers or at the very least gossip magazines. Yet we found no record of this invented controversy in any credible publication. All the quotes are fake and USADailyNewsPosts.com is not a credible source of information.,,0,0,,

Mixture RATING Mixture WHATS TRUE In an April 2017 post on an anarchist web site a group claimed to have poured concrete on train tracks in Washington to prevent the shipment of fracking materials. WHATS FALSE Whether the group actually poured concrete on train tracks is unknown the claimed site of the sabotage was 15 miles away from where the Amtrak accident actually occurred and officials have found no evidence that vandalized rails were the cause of the crash. ORIGIN On 18 December 2017 an Amtrak passenger train derailed south of Seattle Washington killing several people. Shortly afterwards conspiratorial web sites and Internet personalities began pointing to a now-deleted April 2017 post on the anarchist web site ItsGoingDown.org in which an anarchist group claimed to have poured concrete on train tracks 15 miles away from the accident scene to prevent the shipment of fracking materials. Sites such as the Gateway Pundit InfoWars and Internet personality Mike Cernovich dug up the eight-month-old post suggesting a link to the Amtrak derailment with statements like the following: While law enforcement is still investigating the cause behind the trains derailment ANTIFA reportedly sabotaging the tracks and then deleting the post raises serious question about there potential involvement in Mondays incident. Anti-fascists or antifa are a loose collective of leaderless groups mostly made up of anarchists or people with far-left political views. Theres no credible information to support the claim that any of these groups were involved in the train derailment. Hours after the incident the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that when Train 501 left the tracks it was going 80 miles per hour in a 30-mile-per-hour zone during its inaugural run on the new route between Seattle and Portland Oregon. Investigators have found no evidence that vandalized tracks were the cause of the accident. In a phone interview Cernovich pushed back against the criticism that he had spread unverified information to his hundreds of thousands of followers telling us that he had made it clear that the theory was mere speculation: I was clear to say it could be something it could be nothing and nobody knows anything. But if theres going to be a blanket rule that nobodys allowed to speculate about anything then Ill follow that rule if everybody else does. Cernovich acknowledged his large following gives his words a long reach: One criticism that is legitimate is [I] need to word things precisely because of the size of [my] platform. Thats a criticism that I take to heart. Most people would agree Ive toned thing down considerably. A source from Its Going Down who provided only the name James A. told us that Puget Sound Anarchists had sent in the April post after receiving it from another group. The group claimed to have poured cement on BNSF-owned tracks that lead out of the Port of Olympia which is actually about 15 miles from the site of the Amtrak train derailment: Early in the morning of April 20th we poured concrete on the train tracks that lead out of the Port of Olympia to block any trains from using the tracks. We took precautions to notify BNSF (the train company) we called them and we used wires to send a signal that the tracks were blocked. We did this not to avoid damaging a train nothing would bring bigger grins to our faces but to avoid the risk of injuring railway workers. None of Its Going Down BNSF or the Olympia Police Department would confirm or deny whether the sabotaging incident boasted of in April 2017 actually occurred. In an email James A. told us that: It is important to note that this site receives and reposts anonymous communiques (with the level of discernment that comes from a group of anarchists who have been a part of many movements for several decades / fact checking (when possible)). In this instance we relayed a transmission that PSA [Pugent Sound Anarchists] had received. It should be noted that Puget Sound Anarchists did not claim the action they were just the online outlet where such a message was received and posted it was not signed by them. We removed the article on our site some months ago because it was too laborious for us continue dealing with the spam it generated. We have no reason to believe Aprils action did not happen but also have no evidence at this particular moment to suggest that it did. In any case it was removed well before this latest tragedy. Our reading of the communique is that individual(s) stopped a train (not derailing it). They took precautions to protect human life and reach their goal by both signalling the company and sending a message on the tracks. This seemed synchronous with the spirit and intention of their goal stop natural gas fracking. A spokeswoman for BNSF referred us to Olympia police. Lt. Sam Costello wouldnt confirm whether police had any reports of such vandalism saying: I do understand that many are beginning to look back at things historically in the Olympia area today likely due to the incident this morning. We have had instances of people engaging in protest-type activity on rail tracks in Olympia but I cannot say that those protests have anything to do with todays tragic derailment. Port of Olympia spokeswoman Jennie Foglia-Jones said port workers were aware of the blog post when it was published but couldnt confirm whether any concrete was actually poured at that time. If it was it wouldnt have been the first vandalism of its type. In August 2014 a Tacoma Rail train crashed into a concrete block that was placed on the track resulting in a punctured fuel tank and massive spill. The collision financially crippled publicly-owned Tacoma Rail. No suspect was ever identified. Its true the port has been the target of anti-fracking activists angry that materials shipped from there on freight trains are used in natural gas exploration. But the train involved in the Monday morning derailment was a passenger train that doesnt appear to have anything to do with the port which is miles away from the site of the accident. The amorphous antifa have gained notoriety in 2017 by physically fighting white supremacists at rallies in places like Berkeley and Charlottesville. Increasingly the group has become the subject of rumors and false claims it was falsely blamed for the 1 October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas and falsely accused of plotting a violent uprising on 4 November 2017.

(See 0 likes Like,"CLAIM Roy Moore accuser Beverly Young Nelson ""forged"" Moores signature and inscription in her high school yearbook. Mixture RATING Mixture WHATS TRUE Beverly Young Nelson acknowledged that she had added annotations to Moores 1977 inscription and signature in her high school yearbook. WHATS FALSE Nelson did not admit that she ""forged"" either the inscription Moore wrote or his accompanying signature. ORIGIN In November 2017 the run-up to an election to fill a vacant U.S. Senate seat in Alabama became one of the most contentious political issues of the year when multiple women came forward and accused the Republican candidate a former district attorney and state judge of sexual assault. One of those women Beverly Young Nelson maintained that Moore had tried to force himself upon her when he was 30 and she was just a 16-year-old high school student: Beverly Young Nelson says she was working as a waitress at the Olde Hickory House in Gadsden Ala. in 1977 and the then-district attorney was a regular customer who often tried to grab her long red hair and flirt. One night he offered to drive her home and she trusted him because he was the DA but once she got in the car he parked next to a dumpster behind the restaurant Nelson said at a Manhattan press conference with attorney Gloria Allred. I tried to open my car door to leave but he reached over and locked it so I could not get out. I tried fighting him off while yelling at him to stop but instead of stopping he began squeezing my neck attempting to force my head onto his crotch. I continued to struggle. I was determined that I was not going to allow him to force me to have sex with him. I was terrified. He was also struggling to pull my shirt off she said. I thought that he was going to rape me. I was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop. I had tears running down my face Nelson said. When he finally gave up Moore allegedly told her: You are a child. I am the district attorney of Etiwah County. If you tell anyone about this no one will believe you. He then let her out of the car and he sped off. Moore claimed in response that he didnt even know Nelson but she offered a contrary piece of evidence documenting that he did her high school yearbook which Moore had signed below the inscription To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas just weeks before the alleged attack: Moores signature in the yearbook was followed by the abbreviation D.A. (for district attorney) with the 12-22-77 and Olde Hickory House written below it (signifying the time and place of the signing). Moores defenders including attorney Philip Jauregui contended that the yearbook inscription was a forgery asserting that Moores signature had been lifted from a court document that the handwriting appeared inconsistent in style and that Moore would not have written D.A. after his name since he was only an assistant district attorney at the time: Jauregui said that he is sending a letter to Allred demanding that she and Nelson turn over the yearbook itself and subject the message to an analysis by a handwriting expert. Is it genuine? Or a fraud? Jauregui said urging the public to compare the yearbook against Moores handwriting themselves. Judge Moore says theres no way in the world that thats his handwriting Im asking you all to take a look and make a judgment. Judge Moore looked at that D.A. after that signature Jauregui said. No he wasnt [district attorney] he was the assistant district attorney. About three weeks later Nelson admitted to a Good Morning America reporter that she herself had added the wording below Moores name in order to remind herself [of] who Roy Moore was and where and when Mr. Moore signed her yearbook. Critics immediately seized upon the admission and maintained that Nelson had lied that she had tampered with Moores signature and even that she had admitted she forged the yearbook: Although some misunderstanding or misrepresentation certainly surrounded Nelsons claims the language with which they were commonly characterized in right-wing news reports was itself hyperbolic and inaccurate. Nelson didnt lie about the annotations (she hadnt claimed that Moore had written them himself although neither had she previously explained that he hadnt) she didnt tamper with Moores signature (other than possibly appending the abbreviation D.A. to it) and she didnt forge (i.e. fraudulently create) any portion of the yearbook or its contents. Fox News at least corrected their account to note that Nelson had acknowledged adding notes to the yearbook rather than forging Moores inscription as Fox had originally reported: A since-deleted tweet on the official Fox News twitter account had read BREAKING NEWS: Roy Moore accuser admits she forged part of yearbook inscription attributed to Alabama senate candidate. Fox News has since updated the story with a note at the bottom of the piece while removing any references to forgery in it. An update to this story reflects that Beverly Young Nelson admits writing what ABC News characterized as notes beneath what she says is Roy Moores signature and that the only notes below the signature are the date and location. Furthermore the headline on [the] story now specifies that Nelson admits to writing part of the inscription herself rather than forging part of it. At a subsequent news conference Nelsons lawyer Gloria Allred released the findings of a handwriting analyst who concluded that the signature on the yearbook inscription did indeed belong to Roy Moore.",,0,0,,

And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription. Worse still the reporter actually coaches Nelson puts words in her mouth downplay the enormous significance of her deceit. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription ABC News tells us. But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbook ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence. Llamas also fails to ask any follow-ups such as If the explanation is this simple why wait all these weeks to offer it? Or Why did you lie? Nelson is accusing Moore of attempting to assault her when she was just 16-years-old. With the election just four days away this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for Moore. Nelson and Allred are planning a news conference Friday but nothing will overcome the forgery admission. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama. Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. Now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore. One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfmans living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. Thanks to New Medias going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moores office on business. If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an unfit absent and unstable mother. If the media and the accusers and Gloria Allred told the full truth to begin with they would all be more credible. As far as the accusations against Moore involving his wanting to date teenage girls those are trumped-up charges utter nonsense. The age of consent in Alabama was and is 16. Moreover 40 years ago it was not at all uncommon in the South for a 32-year-old man to seek a much younger bride. So not only did Moore not break the law he was not violating any social mores.,"CLAIM The Muslim mayor of ""Blairsville Michigan"" has outlawed Christmas within the citys limits. False RATING False ORIGIN On 3 September 2017 the satirical web site AsAmericanAsApplePie.org playing off the recurrent creeping sharia conspiracy theory posted a fake story reporting that the Muslim mayor of the fictional town of Blairsville Michigan had outlawed Christmas in the city as of 2017: The Muslim Mayor of Blairsville a small suburb of Dearborn Michigan has declared by executive action that Christmas decorations music or festivities of any kind in view of the public is offensive to the majority of residents and therefore forbidden. The town with a population of nearly 120K people is 52 percent Muslim as of the 2010 census and probably slightly higher since. The remaining residents are 3rd and 4th generation American families who have been living on family land or settling the area in general for 250 years but their rights dont matter[.] For starters there is no suburb of Dearborn Michigan called Blairsville and the photograph used in the story to depict a supposed Christmas-banning Muslim cleric is actually an Associated Press photograph of Mohammad Qatanani the leader of a mosque in New Jersey who has been in the news because he has been fighting potential deportation. It is clear from AsAmericanAsApplePie.orgs About page that it is a satire site that is not meant to be taken literally: When no one can trust the lying fake news liberal media anymore because they hate us and guns and Harley Davidson and meat and OUR president As American as Apple Pie is here to be your beacon of something you can kinda rely on sometimes but not really. Whether one thinks the content of the site is funny is subjective but the post seems intended to play off anti-Muslim sentiments and ongoing fearmongering over an alleged war on Christmas which is recycled in one form or another every year despite a consistent lack of evidence to support its assertions.

False RATING False ORIGIN On 8 December 2017 a self-described satire website going by the name No Fake News Online published a story with the following headline: BREAKING: Roy Moores Accuser Arrested And Charged With Falsification While the contents of the article are despite the sites name and according to its disclaimer made up the headline plays on a controversy generated by Roy Moore accuser Beverly Young Nelsons interview with ABC News where she said that she had added notes under a yearbook inscription attributed to Moore: specifically the date and location written under Moores signature. Fox News in their coverage of this interview tweeted (and then redacted) a shocking headline: Roy Moore accuser admits she forged part of yearbook inscription attributed to Alabama senate candidate. Fox later deleted the tweet and substantially altered their coverage appending an update to their story: An update to this story reflects that Beverly Young Nelson admits writing what ABC News characterized as notes beneath what she says is Roy Moores signature and that the only notes below the signature are the date and location. Furthermore the headline on story now specifies that Nelson admits to writing part of the inscription herself rather than forging part of it. While No Fake News Online uses a made-up name for the Roy Moore accuser in their story (Mary Lynne Davies) it clearly plays on this earlier controversy: After it was discovered that Roy Moores accuser is a liar and a Democrat Alabama Attorney General John Simmons filed charges of falsification a 1st-degree misdemeanor. Mary Lynne Davies who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines. The revelation came after the yearbook inscription that Moore supposedly wrote in the 1970s turned out to be a forgery. Davies who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. No Fake News Online describes itself however as a whimsical playland of conservative satire and their about page contains this disclaimer: Everything on this website is fiction.

False RATING False ORIGIN On 18 December 2017 an Amtrak train on its way from Seattle to Portland derailed and crashed in DuPont Washington killing three people and leaving scores of others injured. According to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) the train was traveling nearly 80 miles per hour in a 30-mile-per-hour zone at the time of the accident. Shortly after the tragedy various disreputable web sites published articles under headlines such as BREAKING: FBI Identifies Muslim Terrorist Who Derailed Amtrak Train and Derailed Amtrak Train Was No Accident After All Muslim Man Arrested holding that the crash was deliberately caused by a Muslim terrorist who sabotaged the tracks to cause a derailment (supposedly employing a method common to urban legendry): The Amtrak tragedy over the weekend was as we all predicted no accident and according to the FBI the terrorist was from the religion of peace. Muhammad Christopher Blair 53 was born in rural Ohio to a Christian woman and a Muslim man she fell in love with who ultimately abandoned his family but his religion and his hatred of America lived on through Blair who was apparently activated over the weekend when he placed a gold Sacajawea dollar on the tracks above an overpass in Washington state in order to derail the train. Traditionally a penny would be used (thats what you see in old cartoons right?) but the United Railway Administration began requiring changes in trains that would prevent coins at the time from causing damage when kids decided they wanted to play a prank. The gold dollar however is thicker than any currency at the time and is capable to causing a train to derail according to Harvard physics professor Dr. James Wright.

Cant remember the last few words.

It would be easier to accept NASAs official explanation if they were not so secretive about everything they study and do in space but one thing is for certain NASAs own personnel have admitted that lithium along with other chemicals are intentionally being placed into our environment regularly. It is possible that many of NASAs own employees arent even aware of the true motivations for carrying out such a project ironically displaying the very behaviors that these chemicals/pharmaceuticals are meant to instill. In the first bomb-shell video a NASA employee ([redacted]@nasa.gov) admits that lithium is being sprayed in the atmosphere and says that it is harmless to the environment.

From there the article made its case for the existence of a NASA lithium spraying program (without any citations and bearing a strong similarity to a previous hoax): It is very real and there is ample scientific documentation to corroborate what I put forth here: A Pub Med abstract titled Feasibility of Aerosol Vaccinations in Humans discusses how an increase in antigen volumes can be beneficial in aerosol delivery of vaccines and could be used in developing countries and disaster areas. The abstract also admits that several thousand human subjects have already been aerosol vaccinated with live attenuated measles and influenza A vaccines. The executive summary further states that aerosol vaccinations are ideal for large populations. This has apparently been happening since as early as 2003. Another discussion of aerosolized vaccinations can be found in The New England Journal of Medicine. A Randomized Controlled Trial of Aerosolized Vaccines Against Measles states that these vaccines were tested on children in India that were as young 9 months old. The World Health Organization has been researching aerosol vaccines for years now as have philanthropic agencies which have clear aims to sterilize the population. It is also worth noting that the pharmaceutical industry has been absolved from any legal responsibility for medicating the masses since they were awarded legal protection from all lawsuits by Congress in 1986. This law was challenged but upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011. Many powerful agencies are making sure that we take our medicine. In fact many nations are participating in our unwitting forced vaccination and the dumping of any number of attenuated viruses chemical concoctions and other chemtrails on our heads with dogged frequency. The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) considered giving a license application to PaxVax Australia (PaxVax) for the intentional release of a GMO vaccine consisting of live bacteria into the environment in Queensland South Australia Western Australia and Victoria. They planned to release cholera on their people. According to the regulator this GMO vaccine qualified as a limited and controlled release under section 50A of the Gene Technology Act 2000. Of course we cant ignore the USA. Michael Greenwood wrote an article stating that: The incidence of human West Nile virus cases can be significantly reduced through largescale aerial spraying that targets adult mosquitoes according to research by the Yale School of Public Health and the California Department of Public Health. Buried among the tinfoil were a few actual facts: it was true that a 2003 study examined the feasibility of mass vaccination by air but that didnt in any way suggest NASA was dosing Americans with lithium without their knowledge or consent. Another unrelated piece of proof offered up by the author was the widespread and well-documented efforts to combat the spread of West Nile virus by spraying insecticide initiatives that targeted mosquitos not humans. The excerpt also referenced GMO vaccines a term we were unable to even define (a 1998 paper speculated on the promise of genetically engineered vaccines). Also included was a video titled NASA admits chemtrails published to YouTube on 13 July 2013 (and purportedly recorded three days earlier): The clip (which had no video component only audio) was purported to be a recorded phone call between a woman identified only as Sue and NASA astrophysicist Douglas Rowland. Sue brought up a video she watched in which lithium was mentioned and the exchange that followed illustrated how the caller and the NASA scientist were carrying on entirely separate conversations. Sue fixated on the use of the word lithium as Rowland tried to explain NASAs study of the upper atmosphere and why conditions there differed from those at lower altitudes: Sue: When the article came out in the major newspapers including The Huffington Post there was no mention of lithium not one. Not one mention of lithium until I heard the recording of the actual I listened to the rockets go off. I had no idea there was going to be a lithium dispersed until I heard Payload lithium dispersed. Rowland: Right there was lithium dispersed and Id be happy to talk about it. I think you may be under so misconceptions about what were doing but Im happy to tell you any details that you need. Sue: It says in your article that youre doing it for communications. Rowland: There are many reasons were doing it because we dont understand how the wind in the upper atmosphere moves. Chemtrails there are different kinds of chemtrails. Different trails at night. We use different trails during the day. The wind blows them around. They glow either on their own or from scattered sunlight. We take pictures and we can see how the wind trail moves around. Its just like if you were taking a picture of an airplane contrail. You could use that to see how the wind was blowing. This is much higher altitude so we use these chemical trails. Sue: What is the purpose of knowing what the winds going to do in the ionosphere? Rowland: The purpose is really to understand our planet. Its very fundamental science. Every day we know there is electrical current that flow over the head that is naturally there. They have been there ever since the Earth had an atmosphere and electrical field. And the wind is driven by the sun. The sun heats the atmosphere the wind blows and every day that wind drives an electric current and were trying to understand what causes that. Simply how does it work in detail and also importantly when the sun becomes active with lots of sun spots and lots of magnetic activity that changes the wind pattern and changes the electric current. We want to understand both what it is on a regular day when there is no solar activity and then what it is when there is a lot of solar activity. Sue: Is there some other way you can do it without dispersing the lithium? Rowland: Were researching other ways. The lithium is actually harmless to the environment and we can show you more about that but it is tricky to use because its very faint. You cant see it with your naked eye. You have to have special cameras to see it so we dont like to use it for that reason. Its hard measurement to make. Were researching other ways to put censors directly on the rocket to measure the wind and those are ongoing. Were trying to develop them now and one of the purposes of this mission was to do that. Between incorrectly framed data about unrelated studies of mass vaccination or West Nile virus spraying and the video AnonHQ concluded that hopefully weve established that this IS happening when neither the article nor video had established any such thing. What actually transpired was folks (one of whom harassed a NASA scientist and encouraged others to do the same) misinterpreted publicized scientific research to fit a pre-existing conspiracy theory. In the conversation between Rowland and Sue (during which portions were clearly elided) the only admissions made were those about the detail of upper atmosphere study already publicly disclosed on a regular basis by NASA and linked in this article. The use of lithium in such research was neither a secret nor cause for concern. NASA published an article in January 2013 explaining its purpose one of many highlighting projects of the nature Rowland discussed: NASA successfully launched a Terrier-Improved Orion suborbital rocket at 5:50 p.m. EST this evening from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. During the flight two red-colored lithium vapor trails were produced. Reports from those viewing the launch or vapor trails came from as far away as the Outer Banks N.C.; eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Two different methods for creating the lithium vapor were tested to determine which configuration is best for observing various science phenomena in space. NASA has two missions later this year that will use lithium trails to assist scientists in observing events in space In the technology test launch two canisters in the rockets payload section contained solid metal lithium rods or chips embedded in a thermite cake. The thermite was ignited and produced heat to vaporize the lithium. The vapor was released in space to be detected and tracked optically. The lithium combustion process posed no threat to the public during the release in space. When heated the lithium rods change to lithium vapor and small amounts of lithium oxide. The thermite reaction produces iron and aluminum oxide. NASA similarly reported the same sort of research in July 2011 in an openly-available article about the observation of lithium trails in the upper atmosphere: The rockets known as sounding rockets from the nautical term to sound meaning to measure will launch sometime between July 5 and 23 depending on ionospheric and weather conditions. NASAs sounding rocket program at Wallops dates back to the agencys inception in 1958. Not only do sounding rockets offer a low cost way to access space they also provide access to areas of the atmosphere too low for satellites. In this experiment the scientists will fly two pair of rockets. One in each pair will measure data about the charged or ionized gas called plasma as well as the neutral gas through which it travels. The other will shoot out a long trail of lithium gas to track the wind movement. The instrumented rockets are 40 feet long and 17 inches in diameter carrying a payload of 600 lbs. The lithium rockets are 14 inches in diameter and are about six feet long. Beginning July 5 the team will set up each day from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. EDT ready to launch as soon as theres evidence of currents in the ionosphere as well as a crystal clear skies necessary for successful observation of the lithium trail. With all the focus conspiracy sites placed on NASA none appeared to discover the agencys explanation of purpose for lithium in rocket launches (published in 1958 and available freely on the agencys web site): Chemical propellants in common use deliver specific impulse values ranging from about 175 up to about 300 seconds. The most energetic chemical propellants are theoretically capable of specific impulses up to about 400 seconds. High values of specific impulse are obtained from high exhaust-gas temperature and from exhaust gas having very low (molecular) weight. To be efficient therefore a propellant should have a large heat of combustion to yield high temperatures and should produce combustion products containing simple light molecules embodying such elements as hydrogen (the lightest) carbon oxygen fluorine and the lighter metals (aluminum beryllium lithium) Devices such as the nuclear rocket must use some chemical as a working fluid or propellant although no energy is supplied to the rocket by any chemical reaction Propellants that would be suitable for use in electric propulsion devices are the easily ionized metals. The one most generally considered is cesium; next best are rubidium potassium sodium and lithium. On 21 April 2016 we spoke with both Rowland and NASAs Keith Koehler. Koehler confirmed that the tracer rockets in question operated at far higher altitudes than commercial aircraft (chemtrail conspiracies focus on lower altitudes). Koehler explained why vapor tracers were necessary to measure atmospheric conditions: Vapor tracers used in NASA suborbital rocket missions allow scientist to see that which is not visible to the naked eye. They are used to measure atmospheric winds and/or ion drifts in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere typically between 50 and 248 miles altitude (Commercial aircraft fly around six miles altitude.). The vapor is released along a portion of the rocket trajectory. The small amount of vapor is then visible from the ground. By tracking their motions directly with cameras on the ground (or in an airplane) these tracers make it possible to observe the movements of the upper atmosphere or the ionosphere directly. The purpose of the measurements is to understand how the natural upper atmospheric winds and/or ion drifts behave not to change them. The releases would therefore have little value if they were changing the behavior of the upper atmosphere or ionosphere. The tracers are released in a part of the atmosphere where meteors from space deposit 100 to 200 tons of metallic material every day across the globe compared to a one-pound tracer release for example. The meteors contain the same types of metallic material used in the tracers. Use of lithium as a chemical propellant and research agent by NASA was not novel or secretive the rudimentary information on NASAs web site was first published in 1958. Conspiracy theorists latched on to the use of the word lithium and extrapolated that it was used by NASA to surreptitiously drug the populace. NASA openly admitted to using lithium in a manner widely expected of that element but use of the word admitted also implied disclosure by accident or under duress. The practice was well documented both by NASA and outside research and bore no hallmarks of a long-running plot to surreptitiously drug Americans under the guise of rocket launches.",,0,0,,

There have been whispers for weeks about the famed yearbook evidence against Roy Moore which Gloria Allred and her client refused to release for authentication. Now we know why. Its a fake. Breitbart has the story: Beverly Young Nelson has finally admitted that she forged a portion of the infamous high school yearbook that she and attorney Gloria Allred used as proof of her accusations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore. And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription. Worse still the reporter actually coaches Nelson puts words in her mouth downplay the enormous significance of her deceit. Heres an ABC report that exposes her forgery. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 There are some critical red flags beyond just the fact that she forged the year book entry. Breitbart points out that in 1999 Moore ruled against her in a divorce case. And why didnt the interviewer ask followup questions like why didnt you speak up sooner? When you read and watch follow-up reports on this story notice that wording and phrasing is important. ABC says that Beverly Young made notes on the year book entry. Really? Notes? She forged and falsified the yearbook to impugn his person and sabotage his campaign. If Moore doesnt sue her for defamation she will be lucky. Image: Source,CLAIM A Harvard study proved that Apple purposely slows down its older model iPhones to coincide with device releases and to boost sales of new models. Mixture RATING Mixture WHATS TRUE Some recent iOS upgrades slow down the processing speeds of iPhones with degraded batteries. WHATS FALSE The processor slowdown is (according to Apple) intended to prevent unexpected power-related shutdowns and other problems in older iPhones that have batteries whose performance has degraded over time not to boost sales of just-released newer iPhone models. ORIGIN A long-circulating piece of technology lore surrounding the release of new iPhone models holds that Apple unleashes furtive iOS updates in order to dramatically slow down existing iPhone models just before the release of newer models in a case of planned obsolescence intended to increase sales of the latest iPhones. An example of the rumor was illustrated in an episode of the Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: If you were Apple what tricks would you utilize to increase the sales of your latest product? If you know corporations youd know they use any possible trick they can as a generality to increase their profit: think of how huge a factor it would make in the sale of new iPhones if the old ones became slower. People have made the anecdotal observation that their Apple products become much slower right before the release of a new model. Now a Harvard University study has done what any person with Google Trends could do and pointed out that Google searches for iPhone slow spiked multiple times just before the release of a new iPhone each time. On 21 September 2017 a blog post strongly implied that a Harvard study had proved the rumor true: The referenced study was mentioned 26 July 2014 New York Times Upshot blog post authored by Harvard economics professor Sendhil Mullainathan which he describes it as a graduate students casual experiment using Google Trends: Generally my students know enough to ignore my grumbling. But in this instance Laura Trucco a Ph.D. student in economics at Harvard followed a hunch. She wanted to see whether my experience was unique. But how? When people become frustrated with a slow phone she reasoned they search Google to figure out what to do about it. So in theory data on how often people search for iPhone slow as provided by Google Trends can measure the frustration globally. (Data for only the United States show similar results.) Mullainathan contrasted the Google Trends search with a similar one involving Android products noting an absence of similar results and positing: This data has an even more benign explanation. Every major iPhone release coincides with a major new operating system release. Though Apple would not comment on the matter one could speculate and many have that a new operating system optimized for new phones would slow down older phones. This could also explain the Samsung-iPhone difference: Because only 18 percent of Android users have the latest operating systems on their phones whereas 90 percent of iPhone users do any slowdown from a new operating system would be naturally bigger for iPhones. The important distinction is of intent. In the benign explanation a slowdown of old phones is not a specific goal but merely a side effect of optimizing the operating system for newer hardware. Data on search frequency would not allow us to infer intent. No matter how suggestive this data alone doesnt allow you to determine conclusively whether my phone is actually slower and if so why. A December 2017 article from Geekbench charted that some older iPhones did seem to exhibit slower performance after particular iOS upgrades but that their speed picked up once their batteries were replaced: While we expect battery capacity to decrease as batteries age we expect processor performance to stay the same. However users with older iPhones with lower-than-expected Geekbench 4 scores have reported that replacing the battery increases their score (as well as the performance of the phone). Whats going on here? How many phones are experiencing decreased Geekbench 4 score? At that juncture Apple finally acknowledged that yes some recent iOS upgrades did throttle processor speeds in some older model iPhones. But according to Apple that action was intended to address a problem with unexpected power-related shutdowns (and other issues) in older phones caused by their batteries degrading over time and was not as rumor commonly claimed deliberately coincident with the release of newer iPhones in order to drive sales: Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices. Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions have a low battery charge or as they age over time which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components. Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6 iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. Weve now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2 and plan to add support for other products in the future. Although as Geekbench noted the issue might nonetheless serve to increase sales of newer iPhones whether or not that was Apples intended purpose in the absence of any explanation for the sudden change in performance many iPhone users may assume the performance problem is related to their phones (and not specifically to their batteries) and therefore opt to upgrade their iPhone models: If the performance drop is due to [Apples] sudden shutdown fix users will experience reduced performance without notification. Users expect either full performance or reduced performance with a notification that their phone is in low-power mode. This fix creates a third unexpected state [which was] created to mask a deficiency in battery power [but which] users may believe is due to CPU performance instead of battery performance. This fix [can] cause users to think My phone is slow so I should replace it not My phone is slow so I should replace its battery. This will likely feed into the planned obsolescence narrative. On 21 December 2017 a class action lawsuit was filed against Apple over the slowdown issue.,"7im3sn,",0,2,"worldpolitics,","jogman308,"

Rosie ODonnell was openly bribing Republican Senators to vote no on the Tax Bill surprisingly not one Senator took her up on her offer and instead the tweets went viral because its evidence of bribery. Trump now has enough reason to direct federal authorities to lock her up. This is the tweet that Rosie ODonnell tweeted out just a few hours before legislation on the Tax Bill began. so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no s**t 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Despite multiple people pointing out that ODonnell was committing bribery she doubled down on her offer. i disagree it is obvious there is a price corker had one collins too flake almost brave he crawled out backwards 2 million to any GOP senator who votes no on KILLING AMERICANS MILLIONS WITH OUT HEALTH CARE MY GOD HAVE WE NO SO ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Federal law addresses ODonnells actions. 18 U.S. Code 201 criminalizes the attempted bribery of federal officials by whoever directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official with intent to influence any official act. As for jail time Rosie could spend up to 15 years in prison pay up to $12 million in fines and she would never be allowed to run for public office. The statute calls for a fine of not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value whichever is greater or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years or both and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor trust or profit under the United States. If this did go to court Rosie would of course argue that her offer was a joke or that she has a mental illness of some sort and while it would be absolutely hysterical to get Rosie ODonell to admit in court that she has a mental illness over this issue it would be funnier to see her land in prison for a decade. Just like every showdown Trump and Rosie have had before Rosie lost.,CLAIM In October 2017 Sandra Bullock defended President Donald Trump and urged Hillary Clinton to leave the United States. False RATING False ORIGIN In October 2017 several web sites falsely reported that actress Sandra Bullock had publicly defended President Donald Trump while also launching an attack against 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The US World Now web site for example put out an article under the following lengthy headline: Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: If You Dont Like Our President You Can Leave and Never Come Back Again You Are One Jealous Woman Who is Nothing to Compare With Trump I Hope He Will Arrest You Soon. Do You Support Her? The body of the article itself did not contain this quote however. Rather it was composed of copied and pasted sections from a two-year-old People magazine article in which Bullock actually expressed her dislike of Donald Trump: One politician who seemingly wont get the stars vote in the 2016 presidential election? Donald Trump. I dont agree with that at all Bullock said of the candidates comments on Mexican-Americans. That was not a statement that I can get behind. I dont agree with that statement. Not surprisingly this portion of the interview did not make it into the US World Now article. The same fabricated quotation was used as a clickbait headline by the Trump Times and My Info News web sites while the Political Feed worked the fake quote into the body of their article: Sandra Bullock stated that she is not politically vocal but rather that doesnt mean she isnt stubborn with regards to Americas administration. I simply need whats best for our nation Bullock said amid a question and answer session for her new film Our Brand Is Crisis in Los Angeles last Friday. And the best part was when she stated this: If you dont like our current President you can leave our country and never come back especially you Hillary. Hatred is the last thing we need nowadays we must unite. Donald Trump is doing everything he is available of to improve our nation just respect that activity and stay patient. Political Feed made it entirely obvious that the quotation was fabricated by claiming Bullock had made her remarks at a press conference last Friday for her new film Our Brand is Crisis a movie that had actually been released two years earlier.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN A Chicago-area officials comment calling on the United Nations to dispatch peacekeepers to help quell gun violence has been distorted to spark paranoia that feeds into a persistent and popular conspiracy theory about an alleged grand scheme to subvert the sovereignty of the United States. On 14 December 2017 the Chicago Tribune quoted Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin saying he wanted UN Peacekeepers to help put an end to the quiet genocide of African-Americans in Chicago. Boykin flew to UN headquarters in New York to meet with UN officials about the issue. Per the Tribune he said: The United Nations has a track record of protecting minority populations. There was tribal warfare between the Tutsis and the Hutus in Africa and they deployed peacekeeping troops there to help save those populations and reduce the bloodshed. We have to do something black people in Chicago make up 30 percent of the population but 80 percent of those who are killed by gun violence. The story resulted in a flurry of blog posts on sites like Anti-Media IlluminatiExposed.net and Anonymous-Feed.com reporting the possibility there could soon be UN boots on the ground in an American city. The United Nations is a key part of a broad popular and anti-Semitic conspiracy theory known as the New World Order. Subscribers of this conspiracy theory believe that a secretive cabal of super rich and powerful (usually Jewish) men are plotting a global take-over to establish a one-world autocratic government. Conspiracy sites and networks like conspiratorial InfoWars have long promoted the idea that the UN is preparing to invade the United States first by disarming Americans. In a 19 December 2017 segment about Chicago InfoWars host Alex Jones said: Another thing we told you about decades ago thats happening I remember when I was a child hearing about the UN plan of Henry Kissinger to create so much crime in LA and Chicago that finally we would accept UN troops on the streets. Well guess what folks. Here it is. Here it is with all of them saying were gonna have UNESCO come in through the police departments with federal control and use the federal authority to then order police departments that weve bullied and demonized and attacked to sign on to Strong Cities and go under Southern Poverty Law Center-ADL-UN control just like the WikiLeaks said they want them in control of the Internet and those are the same groups in control of Google Facebook and Twitter censorship now. And they want to cover up what theyre doing because theyre directing the take-over. InfoWars editor-at-large Paul Joseph Watson warned in a 19 December 2017 story: The idea of deploying UN peacekeepers on U.S. soil is likely to rile many on the right who have warned about international forces conducting gun confiscation operations domestically for decades. Despite the dire warnings Watsons own reference to decades indicates how long these unsupported rumors have been around. University of California Davis history professor Kathryn Olmstead who specializes in studying conspiracy theories told us: Many conspiracy theories focus on threats to the integrity of the nation. In the 19th and 20th centuries conservative Americans feared Communists Jews Catholics and Masons at least in part because those groups allegedly placed allegiance to an international movement or religion above their duty to their nation. Today American nationalists worry that the United Nations wants to undermine American values or institutions in the pursuit of its internationalist agenda. More specifically RationalWiki points out that the UN is the mechanism conspiracy theorists believe will be used in subordinating the United States to the global order: The New World Order conspiracy started as an extension of old John Birch Society conspiracy theories about the role of the United Nations. This theory claimed that the United Nations was merely a tool of the Communists and that the end goal was the complete subjugation of the United States to the United Nations. This would then set up a world government in which all of the freedoms that Americans hold dear would be abolished. Usually top American officials were claimed to be in on the conspiracy. Patrick Oldendorf spokesman for Boykin said his staff was taken aback by the hostile backlash online to the commissioners comments. Oldendorf said the commissioners comments were blown out of proportion. He never intended to have peacekeeper boots on the ground in Chicago. Instead Boykin was simply in search of ideas to stop an upsurge in homicides in the Windy City. Oldendorf told us: The goal was to find successful strategies that they have implemented elsewhere not guns and tanks but the work that they do that is effective in quelling violence. Even if some of Chicagos local leaders did want UN Peacekeeper boots on the ground an outsider simply making the request to the UN wouldnt result in an international blue helmet mission there. UN Peacekeeping missions are voted on by the Security Council which consists of five permanent member states (China France Russia the United Kingdom and the United States) and 10 countries elected to two-year terms. A UN Peacekeeper spokesman confirmed there is no planning of any kind to send a mission to Chicago. Regardless angry comments proliferated on Boykins official Facebook page in which he was accused of inviting UN troops onto U.S. soil for conspiratorial reasons. One man wrote: What a moronic statement. First of all you do not have the power to invite the UN into our country. Secondly this sounds like a job for the National Guard. Thirdly the UN can take my guns for my cold dead hands. I dont think that they would get too far in my neighborhood. Too many AR15s on my street. Perhaps in an effort to settle the issue Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told the Tribune in response to Boykins comments that UN Peacekeepers have no jurisdiction in Chicago.,,0,0,,

Nelson admitted that she added notes to what Moore had wrote and she is sticking to her story that Moore signed the book do we believe anything she has to say? If you look closely at the alleged signature you can see the that the location and date added is in the same ink as the last name and D.A. So obviously shes lying about that. She added the last name and the D.A. as well as the ink shows. Why couldnt MSM investigate the very apparent two different color inks? The reason Nelson added D.A. despite the fact that he wasnt the D.A. was that he had handled her divorce and signed her order with D.A. at end of his name. His assistant added D.A. to denote that she was signing orders on his behalf. So she was consciously imitating his signature. This also brings into question the accusations from another young woman Debbie Wesson who said Moore dated her when she was 17 and he wrote her a note then. The signature on the note however are eerily similar and we now know that Moore didnt write this one so maybe hes 0 for 2? In this #meetoo culture women are encouraged to come forward with stories of how they have been mistreated sexually by men in power which is a good thing and they should be encouraged to do so but we need to take these accusations very seriously and when these women are found to be lying they should be held responsible. Roy Moore is going be to looked at by people who arent educated on the situation as some sort of a child predator from the message in this womans yearbook and we find out now that the note is fake.,In 1982 a struggling young Canadian-born actor named Michael J. Fox achieved his big breakthrough when he began a run portraying Alex P. Keaton the conservative son of decidedly liberal parents Steven and Elyse Keaton on the hit NBC sitcom Family Ties a role for which he garnered three consecutive Emmy awards as Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. A few years later he leveraged that break into international stardom when he was cast (as a replacement for actor Eric Stoltz) to play Marty McFly the lead character in the hugely popular 1985 adventure-comedy film Back to the Future. In 1991 however when Fox was barely 30 and at the peak of his success he sought medical treatment for a twitch in his finger and the following year he received the devastating diagnosis of young-onset Parkinsons disease (PD) a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement and is typically symptomized by involuntarily body movements and debilitating tremors (and is usually seen in people over the age of 60). Fox gamely concealed his condition while he continued working (primarily playing Mike Flaherty the fictional Deputy Mayor of New York in the ABC sitcom Spin City) but in 1998 he finally went public with the announcement that he was suffering from the disease and embarked upon a second career as a spokesperson and activist for Parkinsons research. Despite his condition Fox has soldiered on with his acting career most recently starring as Mike Henry in NBCs The Michael J. Fox Show portraying a newscaster with Parkinsons who retires from work and also playing a recurring role on the CBS drama The Good Wife as Louis Canning an opposing counsel who suffers from tardive dyskinesia (involuntary visual tremors) and often uses his condition to his advantage by repeatedly calling attention to it in order to elicit sympathy during court appearances. Lately weve fielded many inquiries from readers about whether its true that Michael J. Fox is truly losing a heartbreaking fight against Parkinsons disease most of which seem to have been prompted by a 26 February 2016 Radar Online article of that title (which was also referenced or reproduced on many other web sites). That Radar Online piece reported that Fox was a tragic shell of his former self and had recently experienced great physical difficulty simply getting into a car during a rare night out with his wife: Michael J. Fox is a tragic shell of his former self and so crippled by Parkinsons disease that he needs help getting into a car. On Feb. 15 the reclusive 54-year-old actor tried to enjoy a rare night out with his actress wife Tracy Pollan at the Hollywood restaurant Craigs. As Pollan followed the stricken Back to the Future star whose speech is slurred and who walks with a limp while dragging his left foot was put into the vehicle by several helpers. It was heartbreaking an insider told RadarOnline.com. Michaels bravery knows no bounds. But as the disease takes its toll on his body even he is beginning to see that his battle is a losing one. We cant speak to the private details of how much or how fast Michael J. Foxs physical condition is declining but in a general sense we can assert that he is indeed losing a heartbreaking fight against Parkinsons disease as Parkinsons is a truly heartbreaking condition and everyone who suffers from it is essentially losing the fight because it is a progressive disease with no cure. Some medications (or even brain surgery which Fox underwent in 1998) can provide relief from PD symptoms but they cannot completely check the progression of the disease. Its possible that in the not-too-distant future Michael J. Fox will as Radar Online implied lose the ability to walk on his own and require the use of a wheelchair and/or face the onset of dementia. But many different factors affect the timing and nature of PDs progression and so its impossible to predict exactly how and when any given individual will experience certain aspects of that progression. One thing is certain: Michael J. Fox who in 2007 was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 people whose power talent or moral example is transforming the world has maintained his sense of humor and a forward outlook despite the difficulties of his medical condition. He has also been tireless in using the opportunities afforded by his high public profile to raise awareness of Parkinsons for other less visible sufferers as reported in an account of a talk Fox gave at Pomona College in February 2016: An honest Fox shared his struggles from getting funding for stem cell research to the simple task of getting up in the morning. He acknowledged that although he was visibly shaking on other days its far worse. Fox said he typically wakes up shaking uncontrollably joking that he brushes his teeth with an electric toothbrush even though he doesnt own one. Fox believes everyone should have access to health care. He envisions a future where theres no reason people would hold their hands while gripping coffee because they have to hide Parkinsons from their boss he said. Since his diagnosiss disclosure Fox has worked to eliminate the disease in his lifetime. The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinsons Research has raised $450 million for research. I was in a unique place with the opportunity to help others he shared. As recently as December 2017 Fox told interviewer Dan Primack that [Parkinsons] is not a nebulous cloud of doom that hangs over my head. Its a set of challenges and there are rewards in meeting those challenges.,,0,0,,

All versions provided links which led to web pages (which were not operated or sponsored by Costco) that displayed a Costco logo along with entreaties such as Get a $100.00 Get Costco Gift Card for FREE! or Complete these 3 simple steps below to get Your $200 Costco Cash Card!. These pages asked the unwary to click Facebook Share on Facebook and Comment buttons (thus widely spreading promotion of the scheme to others). Users who followed such instructions were then led into a set of pages prompting them to input a fair amount of personal information (including name address e-mail address date of birth and phone numbers) complete a lengthy series of surveys and finally sign up (and commit to paying) for at least six Reward Offers that usually involve applying for a credit card or signing up for some sort of paid subscription service. Those intent upon snapping up free stuff via such lures should keep in mind that there is often a further downside to the process beyond their personal disappointment and the financial enrichment of the scam artists preying upon their gullibility: All too often such adventures in clickjacking also result in the download of trojans and other viruses onto the computers of those looking to score the promised goodies. Costco themselves says of such schemes that: There are numerous posts circulating on Facebook stating that we are giving away $100 to $1000 Costco Cash Cards to all Facebook users. While we love our fans and members Costco is not giving away Costco Cash Cards to Facebook users and is not associated with this program.

And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription. Worse still the reporter actually coaches Nelson puts words in her mouth downplay the enormous significance of her deceit. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription ABC News tells us. But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbook ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence. Llamas also fails to ask any follow-ups such as If the explanation is this simple why wait all these weeks to offer it? Or Why did you lie? Nelson is accusing Moore of attempting to assault her when she was just 16-years-old. With the election just four days away this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for Moore. Nelson and Allred are planning a news conference Friday but nothing will overcome the forgery admission. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama. Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. Now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore. One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfmans living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. Thanks to New Medias going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moores office on business. If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an unfit absent and unstable mother. If the media and the accusers and Gloria Allred told the full truth to begin with they would all be more credible. As far as the accusations against Moore involving his wanting to date teenage girls those are trumped-up charges utter nonsense. The age of consent in Alabama was and is 16. Moreover 40 years ago it was not at all uncommon in the South for a 32-year-old man to seek a much younger bride. So not only did Moore not break the law he was not violating any social mores.,CLAIM The FBI has warned all Americans to be cautious of produce at grocery stores that might have been sprayed with poison. False RATING False WHATS TRUE In May 2016 the FBI investigated reports of a man who had possibly contaminated food in a Michigan market. WHATS FALSE The FBI has did not issue a general warning to Americans about possibly poisoned produce in grocery stores. ORIGIN On 18 July 2016 the web site Q Political published an article whose alarming headline (FBI Issues Horrifying Warning to Frequent Grocery Shoppers) and opening paragraphs suggested that federal investigators had issued a general warning to Americans about the United States food supply: The FBI issued a horrifying warning to frequent grocery shoppers I cant believe this! Every American needs to see this! After one young mans unthinkable actions washing your fresh fruits and vegetables has never been more important. Reports have now confirmed our worst fears as cameras captured one young man visiting several grocery stores with the sole intent of spraying a poisonous mixture on open food throughout their produce sections. The FBI has issued a warning about going to the grocery store and advises consumers to dispose all foods recently purchased from salad bars. Q Political linked to a Detroit Free Press article as a source for their claims but the linked article (orignially published in May 2016) specified that concerns about affected grocery stores were limited to those in the area around Ann Arbor Michigan and that the FBI had investigated the alleged food contamination and linked it to a single individual there: In a potential food poisoning scare the FBI says it has arrested a man suspected of contaminating produce at open food bars at several Ann Arbor-area grocery stores with a liquid spray containing mice poison hand cleaner and water. State health officials say no one has yet reported getting sick from the potentially contaminated food and it is not yet known if there is any threat to the public. But they are recommending that consumers throw out any salad bar hot bar and ready-to-eat items that were purchased at potentially affected stores in Ann Arbor Saline Midland and Birch Run. The newspaper didnt say the FBI issued a general warning about grocery store produce in the affected area (or anywhere else) just that the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [MDARD] had advised residents of the Ann Arbor region to discard foods that had been purchased from salad bars olive bars and ready-to-eat hot and cold food areas from these stores between mid-March and the end of April: The investigation has prompted the the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to issue a public advisory urging consumers to throw away any potentially contaminated food. State health officials said based on what they know about the ingredients in the mixture at this time they do not anticipate any adverse health effects on individuals who may have eaten the potentially contaminated products. Out of an abundance of caution and to protect public health and food safety I encourage consumers to dispose of any foods purchased from salad bars olive bars and ready-to-eat hot and cold food areas from these stores between mid-March and the end of April said Jamie Clover Adams MDARD director. Although most of these types of foods may have already been eaten or disposed of some may still be in refrigerators or freezers. We contacted MDARD to determine whether the July 2016 article was accurate or whether it represented a continuation of events that occurred in March and April of 2016. An MDARD representative told us that the agency had issued the original salad bar warning in an abundance of caution that no one (to their knowledge) had been sickened by the reported incidents and that a suspect in the case had been arrested in early May 2016. The MDARD representative double-checked with the FBI to ensure that no such general warning had been issued. The original cautionary statement referred only to food from open hot or cold food bars or the produce aisle in one particular store and only to items purchased between late April and early May 2016; the FBI did not (and has not) urged shoppers to avoid grocery stores in general+. (That remained the case when the already misleading claim was republished by Q Political on 12 May 2017.),,0,0,,

Like the sites listed above the Patriot Post (which resides at the misspelled URL PotatriotPost.com) is not a genuine news web site; in addition to carrying a satire tag in its footer the web site also explains in its About page that all of the content on the site is fictional. The web site also defends its own particular brand of satire insisting that it does not publish fake news but instead a new genre (which could perhaps be called fake fake news): Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this sites pure fantasy and actual people places and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. Although the Patriot Post labels its content as fiction its stories like many of its ilk are frequently republished on web sites that carry no such disclaimers. This story for instance was presented as a genuine news article with no disclaimer to speak of on the web site Daily Flash News Viral USA and Right Thing USA making it less satire and more corrosive disinformation. But regardless of where this story was shared or whether or not it should be classified as fake news satire or worse the claim that the Jacksonville Jaguars filed bankruptcy over kneeling thugs is false. The Jacksonville Jaguars have experienced relatively small crowds during the 2017 season but the team did not announce that they were filing for bankruptcy.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 8 December 2017 the Americas Last Line of Defense web site published an article reporting that the daughter of U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer (D.-NY) had recently spoken out about her fathers supposed affair with one of her high school classmates: Things just keep getting worse for the Democrat party. As Republicans like Roy Moore are being exonerated left and right Democrats are falling like dominoes to accusations of sexual assault. The latest may be the worst. Chuck Schumer the holier-than-thou Democrat who has repeatedly called for Judge Roy Moore to drop out of the Senate race over bogus sexual assault charges may be facing a sex scandal of his own. Schumers daughter Lisa has come forward to admit that her father was quite the ladies man to her high school cheerleader friends: My dad is being a hypocrite and thats why Im speaking out. When I was in high school he dated my best friend Rebecca and even got her pregnant twice. He paid for her abortions twice and spent a ton of money onn her at Steak and Shake and Victorias Secret. She fell in love with him and he broke her heart. My Mom paid her to be quiet and go away. Three years later she committed suicide. The girl in question may not be able to testify in court but her diaries which could be admitted as a dying declaration are apparently very detailed. Lisa Schumer says her friends mother entrusted her with the secret telling her to keep it a secret forever if she could. Lisa says she was very concerned that her daughters name would be dragged through the mud. The story is set to break on Reuters and Breitbart first thing in the morning according to Fred Bernswallow. There was no truth to this story: Senator Schumer does not have a daughter named Lisa (his daughters are Jessica and Alison) and neither Reuters nor Breitbart (nor any other real news organization) has published a report on this subject.

The Rightists bills itself as a hybrid web site that publishes articles containing a mixture of fact and fiction. In this case the article started off with a paragraph concerning a one-page ad published in the New York Times by the group Refuse Facism which was reportedly supported by celebrities such as Rosie ODonnell Debra Messing and Ed Asner: The bulk of The Rightists article however was made up of fictional quotes from a non-existent spokesperson. The following paragraphs for instance are complete fabrications: Other Hollywood celebrities who have also joined the campaign however are calling for an all-out strike that would span the entire movie industry in the hopes that such a move would urge the President-elect to resign from his position as the newly elected President of the United States. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops a spokesperson for the Refuse Racism group told The New York Times. Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us not the other way around. Asked to elaborate on why the group is targeting Hollywood out of all the industries in the country as their bargaining chip the spokesperson argued that Hollywood is simply put the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country so to speak the glue thats holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down right? Well thats exactly whats going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is and chooses to step down as President of his own free will.

False RATING False ORIGIN On 24 October 2017 an article began circulating on Facebook with the claim that law enforcement officers in Philadelphia retaliated against Washington Redskins players who took a knee to protest police brutality by refusing escort players from their locker room after a game: The Washington Redskins allowed 11 of their players to take a knee for the National Anthem enraging fans and local law enforcement in Philadelphia. After the game the 14 officers assigned to seeing the team safely to their bus decided to show them the same respect theyre showing our veterans. The men lined up in front of the door took a knee put a fist in the air and shouted Blue Lives Matter! Then the captain informed them that they were on their own and the corp walked out it wasnt until after 5 AM when tailgating closes at the stadium that the team was safe enough to start their long-haul back to DC. The Philadelphia Police Department released a statement that those officers are on the stadium payroll during games and therefore not subject to disciplinary action. Stadium officials say the matter will be handled internally. In other words good job fellas. Show those entitled brats how things really work. Although it is true the Redskins played the Eagles in Philadelphia on 23 October 2017 the claim about police trapping players in their locker room is completely false.

In the first bomb-shell video a NASA employee ( [email protected]) ADMITS that lithium is being sprayed in the atmosphere and says that it is harmless to the environment. Before I give you NASAs official explanation of why they are spraying psych-meds over hundreds of thousands of Americans Id like to point you to some references so that you can do your own research and discover that this is no conspiracy theory. It is very real and there is ample scientific documentation to corroborate what I put forth here: A Pub Med abstract titled Feasibility of Aerosol Vaccinations in Humans discusses how an increase in antigen volumes can be beneficial in aerosol delivery of vaccines and could be used in developing countries and disaster areas. The abstract also admits that several thousand human subjects have already been aerosol vaccinated with live attenuated measles and influenza A vaccines. The executive summary further states that aerosol vaccinations are ideal for large populations. This has apparently been happening since as early as 2003. Another discussion of aerosolized vaccinations can be found in The New England Journal of Medicine. A Randomized Controlled Trial of Aerosolized Vaccines Against Measles states that these vaccines were tested on children in India that were as young 9 months old. The World Health Organization has been researching aerosol vaccines for years now as have philanthropic agencies which have clear aims to sterilize the population. It is also worth noting that the pharmaceutical industry has been absolved from any legal responsibility for medicating the masses since they were awarded legal protection from all lawsuits by Congress in 1986. This law was challenged but upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011. Many powerful agencies are making sure that we take our medicine. In fact many nations are participating in our unwitting forced vaccination and the dumping of any number of attenuated viruses chemical concoctions and other chemtrails on our heads with dogged frequency. The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) considered giving a license application to PaxVax Australia (PaxVax) for the intentional release of a GMO vaccine consisting of live bacteria into the environment in Queensland South Australia Western Australia and Victoria. They planned to release cholera on their people. According to the regulator this GMO vaccine qualified as a limited and controlled release under section 50A of the Gene Technology Act 2000. Of course we cant ignore the USA. Michael Greenwood wrote an article stating that: The incidence of human West Nile virus cases can be significantly reduced through largescale aerial spraying that targets adult mosquitoes according to research by the Yale School of Public Health and the California Department of Public Health. So hopefully weve established that this IS happening. But why? As more nations refuse genetically modified food and refuse to drink fluoridated water which has been named as a neurotoxin by one of the worlds premiere medical journals the power structure that desires a complicit population has to figure out a way to alter our neurochemistry. Lithium alters how we think by changing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine secreted by our endocrine system. Lithium strongly alters the brain system yet the NASA employee in the above video states that it is not dangerous and doesnt harm the population. Even doctors who normally prescribe this medication for the mentally ill have said that it is dangerous because it is hard to figure out proper dosing. Surely spraying copious amounts of lithium indiscriminately into the air via aerosols should be questioned but heres NASAs official stance on this practice: The project is studying neutral and charged particles in the ionosphere and how each affects the way the other moves resulting in currents in the region. The variations matter because all of our communications and GPS satellites send signals through the ionosphere. A disturbed ionosphere translates to disturbed signals so scientists want to know just what causes the ionosphere to behave in specific ways. (NASA) Meanwhile should the over-medicated start to actually figure out what is being done to them the government has imposed gag orders on the National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) who might easily refute the ridiculous claims of NASA. The US Navy admits to conducting electromagnetic warfare drills over the Olympic Peninsula. Reader submitted photo. Notably every single person who works for NASA the NWS or NOAA are paid with tax payer dollars. This means that we are paying to be medicated and poisoned. Here to corroborate information being given by the NASA employee in the video is the Code 8440 RMMOwhich states the exact purpose of using Wallops Flight Facility to launch a rocket containing lithium thermite: Purpose: The primary purpose of this mission was to test the loading methods for lithium canisters to be flown on the upcoming Kudeki (Kwajalein April 2013) and Pfaff (Wallops June 2013) missions and verify their functionality under sounding rocket launch and space flight conditions. Rocket Type: Two-stage Terrier MK70 Improved-Orion Location: Wallops Range Launcher: MRL Date of Launch: January 29 2013 Time: 17:50 EST Experiment results: Thermistor data looked nominal. Good report from airborne optical platform of recorded video and lithium clouds also visible by ground observation. We also learn from this specific call that lithium has been dumped in our skies since 1970. If you wanted to medicate the masses to create mindless slave-like prisoners who didnt even know they were imprisoned this is surely a good way to do it. Spraying lithium into our skies along with countless other bacteria viruses prions parasites fungi carcinogens toxins hormone-altering drugs anti-flora and anti-fauna as well as gene-altering micro-dust is nothing more than bio-warfare against the worlds citizenry. You can call them chemtrails or something else the effect is the same. The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed our minds are molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. In almost every act of our daily lives whether in the sphere of politics or business in our social conduct or our ethical thinking we are dominated by the relatively small number of personswho understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind. ~ Edward L.

False RATING False ORIGIN On 1 May 2017 the web site World News Daily Report (a notorious purveyor of fake news) posted an article seemingly reporting that a babysitter in Cincinnati Ohio was admitted to a local hospital after paramedics found a toddler wedged in her vagina: Latifah Brown called 911 around 9:30 PM last night reporting that she had a baby stuck in her vagina. The operator first assumed that she was giving birth at home and dispatched an ambulance to the site. The paramedics had quite a surprise when they arrived on the site and saw what was actually happening. One of the paramedics Brian Whitmore related the incident in an interview with WBNS-10 TV. The little boy wore a diaper and pyjamas but he had his legs and abdomen stuck in the womans vagina. The paramedics spent more than an hour on the site trying to release the child from his difficult position but were unable to get the toddler out. After being transported to a hospital where doctors successfully removed the baby (the article continues) Brown confessed to deliberately inserting the child in her vaginal cavity and was charged by police with aggravated child neglect. Not a word of which is true. As we have noted on many occasions (and as World News Daily Report states on its own disclaimer page) all of the content on the site is fictional:,,0,0,,

Mostly False RATING Mostly False ORIGIN For decades scientists have alleged a connection between aluminum and Alzheimers disease and whether such a link exists has been the subject of a long-standing debate within the scientific community. (Indeed when silent film great Rudolph Valentino passed away from a perforated ulcer in 1926 rumor held that his demise was caused by his consuming food prepared in aluminum cookware.) The more specific claim about the health dangers cooking with aluminum foil often pops up in viral news stories such as one published on clickbait site awm.com under the headline Doctors Now Have Warning: If You Use Aluminum Foil Stop It or Face Deadly Consequences which made the following argument: Simply put if you cook with aluminum foil you are playing with your health. The first thing you need to know is that aluminum is bad for your brain. It is a neurotoxic heavy metal that has been linked to Alzheimers disease for years. This claim rests on three assertions. First that cooking with aluminum foil will liberate aluminum and be transferred to your food in a form that can be ingested; second that this aluminum will reach your brain in concentrations high enough to be significant; and third that high concentrations of aluminum in your brain put you at increased risk of Alzheimers. Will cooking with aluminum foil liberate aluminum? Yes acids typically dissolve metals and aluminum is no exception. A 2012 study published in the International Journal of Electrochemical Science which is often cited in viral news stories because of its more alarmist claims about Alzheimers investigated how much aluminum was liberated through the process of cooking food in foil. Not surprisingly researchers found the amount varied depending upon factors such as temperature and acidity but that some aluminum did in fact leach into food cooked in foil: Aluminum foil used in cooking provides an easy channel for the metal to enter the human body. The increase in cooking temperature causes more leaching. The leaching is also highly dependent on the pH value of the food solution salt and spices added to the food solutions. How much of that leached aluminum would stay in your body? Not much most research on the topic agrees that its much less than 1%. A 2011 report published in the journal Neuroscience stated that healthy humans and laboratory rats absorb between 0.06% and 0.4% of ingested Al. Could some of that ~0.4% of leached aluminum make it to your brain? Based on studies that directly injected rats with high doses of aluminum the answer is yes but not much. According to the World Health Organization once the aluminum does make it into your bloodstream a very small percentage (of an already small percentage of ingested aluminum) actually ends up in your brain: Approximately 60 25 10 3 and 1% of the aluminium body burden is in the bone lung muscle liver and brain respectively. The amount of aluminum you would need to eat on a regular basis to see much of a buildup in your brain is unrealistically large. But for the sake of argument lets say some of that leached aluminum does get into your brain. Will it increase your risk factor for Alzheimers? The debate over a connection between aluminum and Alzheimers has gone on for decades originally inspired by the observation that the brains of Alzheimers patients have high concentrations of aluminum compounds and that a major symptom of the disease is the buildup of plaque that contains aluminum compounds. At the moment the field remains mixed on the role of aluminum as a possible risk factor for Alzheimers. Both the Alzheimers Society of Canada and the international Alzheimers Associations official stance is that aluminum is not a risk factor for the disease. A 2008 CDC toxicology report describes the scientific consensus as follows: Although a possible association was proposed over 40 years ago this association is still highly controversial and there is little consensus regarding current evidence. A number of studies have found weak associations between living in areas with elevated aluminum levels in drinking water and an increased risk (or prevalence) of Alzheimers disease; other studies have not found significant associations. In contrast no significant associations have been found between tea consumption or antacid use and the risk of Alzheimers disease; although the levels of aluminum in tea and antacids are very high compared to drinking water aluminum from these sources is poorly absorbed. The available data do not suggest that aluminum is a causative agent of Alzheimers disease; however it is possible that it may play a role in the disease development. More recent studies have come to light that may end up reinvigorating the debate but both the connection of aluminum to Alzheimers and its mechanism for causing the disease are far from settled science. That being said its incredibly unlikely you are exposing your brain to high concentrations of aluminum by cooking with aluminum foil in the first place.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 22 November 2017 the web sites Neon Nettle and YourNewsWire.com (among others) published reports about euthanasia and pediatric patients in Canada claiming that a controversial new law now allows parents to end the lives of children with disabilities: The legislation extends existing assisted suicide laws that have been legal in Canada over a year now in which adults can legally volunteer to end their own life. The new legislation passes the responsibility of consensual death for minors over to the parents. Liftsitenews.com reports: American anti-euthanasia activist Wesley Smith said the results of the survey prove the morally slippery slope that a nation slides down when it agrees that killing is an acceptable answer to human suffering. Once euthanasia consciousness is unleashed it never stops expanding he wrote in the National Review. I guess Robert Latimera Canadian farmer who murdered his daughter because she had cerebral palsywas a visionary he added. Neither site referenced any news reports to support the claims linking instead to a 26 October 2017 National Review Online speculative editorial: Canada Child Euthanasia: A Matter of Time? That opinion piece speculated that legal euthanasia in Canada could eventually be available to minors: Once euthanasia consciousness is unleashed it never stops expanding. The law is still brand new and yet there is already talk about allowing dementia patients to be killed and a mentally ill patient was euthanized with the permission of a court. And now children are in the target range. From the CBC story: The Canadian Paediatric Society says its members are increasingly being asked by parents about the option of seeking medically assisted death for children while a survey of doctors found nearly half of the respondents supported assisted death for kids with progressive terminal illness or intractable pain. The linked article examines the provisions of euthanasia-related legislation passed in June 2016 (Bill C-14). Among them is a years-long review of youth access to medically assisted dying: Medical assistance in dying is something that has been legislated [for adults] and stated [as] needing to be accessible but there isnt the same oomph for saying that all Canadians need good access to palliative care said Dr. Dawn Davies chair of the societys bioethics committee and a pediatric palliative care physician in Edmonton in an interview with CBC News. Where the issue of medical assistance in dying is ever raised by a child you know we would advocate that that should automatically be a referral for pediatric palliative care. When Bill C-14 the law governing medically assisted dying for adults was passed in June 2016 it included a requirement that the ministers of justice and health initiate an independent review on whether mature minors youth under age 18 but deemed capable of giving consent should be eligible for medically assisted death. That review is expected to be presented to Parliament by December 2018. According to the report ongoing research includes feedback from pediatricians about discussions with the parents of critically ill minors: In addition to the mature minors question the surveys also found that parents are asking pediatricians about assisted death on behalf of their critically ill children. Out of the 1050 pediatricians who responded 118 said they had exploratory discussions about assisted death with the parents of sick children involving 419 kids in all. Forty-five respondents said they had received explicit requests for assisted death from parents involving a total of 91 children. More than half of the requests involved a child under a year old. There needs to be a recognition that parents are making this request not as a self-serving thing Davies told The Canadian Press. [Those] children have illnesses where there is really profound suffering. Canadas Department of Justices Questions and Answers page (archived) about the June 2016 law addresses mature minors but not parents: At this time not enough is known about the risks and benefits of medical assistance in dying for minors. The trial judge in [a related ruling] found that to the degree that there was a societal consensus on eligibility for medical assistance in dying it was limited to mentally competent or capable adults. However the Government would also initiate an independent review of the special considerations related to requests for medical assistance in dying by mature minors within 180 days of the legislation receiving Royal Assent. On 22 November 2017 YourNewsWire.com reported that Doctors in Canada have been given the green-light to euthanise disabled sick or dying children under a controversial new law. The controversial new law passed in June 2016 not November 2017. Further that law specifically prohibits even mature minors (much less parents) the ability to choose medically assisted death and it is not by even the most creative interpretation a free pass to euthanize children.",,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 20 October 2016 the website Morning News USA published a story (now with an editors note that the claims have been debunked) reporting that a popular childrens television character named Peppa Pig caused children to develop autism by inspiring them to replicate her irreverent attitude toward authority. This transparent piece of clickbait which was picked up by a number of other websites and social media accounts cited a 2012 University of Harvard study: Experts claimed that Peppa suffers from superiority complex shows inappropriate behavior is impolite intolerant disrespectful envious arrogant and proud. These are not the traits that children should emulate! They claimed that Peppa Pig is breeding disrespectful behavior among children. Besides researchers from the University of Harvard published the result of an experiment that they conducted in 2012. It said that watching Peppa Pig was one of the main causes of autism among children. Marc Wildemberg an epidemiologist who was the lead researcher said: children exposed to at least 30 minutes a day of the show have a 56% higher probability of developing autism. Outside of the clear misrepresentations of both autism and science there are a number of equally obvious hints that this research is entirely fabricated. First of all the University of Harvard is not a real place (Harvard University is though). Second Harvard University has not mentioned the study on any of their webpages and a brief search of Google Scholar reveals that this is because the study itself does not exist. Third Marc Wildemberg who probably doesnt exist either has never been associated with Harvard and has no web presence to speak of. The connection between autism and television was controversially suggested by an economist based solely on correlations between rain cable television subscriptions and autism rates in three states. The study published as a non-peer reviewed National Bureau of Economic Research working paper has since been widely criticized: [Lead author] Prof. Waldmans findings do nothing to explain the mechanism by which television would influence autism a gap that instrumental variables are inherently unable to fill. Thats one reason many autism researchers think he shouldnt have publicized his results or made recommendations to parents. I think this is irresponsible says [autism specialist] Dr. Klin of Yale. We should not provide clinical advice unless there is scientific evidence to substantiate it. Further the assertion that autism is a learned behavior is not rooted any science. While the cause is unknown many scientists believe it is the result of a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. Finally to characterize autism as simply rude behavior offensively suggests that the behavior of an autistic person is necessarily bothersome and intentionally at that. In reality autism is composed of a broad spectrum of conditions related to an individuals ability to interact and behave socially. As defined by the CDC: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can cause significant social communication and behavioral challenges. There is often nothing about how people with ASD look that sets them apart from other people but people with ASD may communicate interact behave and learn in ways that are different from most other people. The learning thinking and problem-solving abilities of people with ASD can range from gifted to severely challenged. Some people with ASD need a lot of help in their daily lives; others need less. This blatant piece of viral pseudoscience fear-mongering however is not the kind of help people with ASD or their parents and caregivers need. Morning News USA has since cast their own (muted) doubt on the story updating their post with the caveat that University of Harvard epidemiologist Marc Wildemberg does not seem [to be] a credible person to claim that watching Peppa Pig can lead to autism.,,0,0,,

Source: http://indigenousnetwork.net,CLAIM Julia Roberts said that former First Lady Michelle Obama was not fit to clean Melania Trumps toilet. False RATING False ORIGIN In December 2017 USA Today published a searing column from its editorial board concluding that Donald Trump is not suited to be president of the United States. It contained the following passage: And as is the case with all of Trumps digital provocations the presidents words were deliberate. He pours the gasoline of sexist language and lights the match gleefully knowing how it will burst into flame in a country reeling from the #MeToo moment. A president who would all but call Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand a whore is not fit to clean the toilets in the Barack Obama Presidential Library or to shine the shoes of George W. Bush. This isnt about the policy differences we have with all presidents or our disappointment in some of their decisions. Obama and Bush both failed in many ways. They broke promises and told untruths but the basic decency of each man was never in doubt. Donald Trump the man on the other hand is uniquely awful. His sickening behavior is corrosive to the enterprise of a shared governance based on common values and the consent of the governed. One day later as doggedly committed to unoriginal fake news as ever repeat offender YourNewsWire.com repurposed the quote in order to claim that actress Julia Roberts had made a series of meanspirited comments about former First Lady Michelle Obama: First Lady Melania Trump has been looked down upon and disrespected by sneering liberals across the country while doing a brilliant job according to Julia Roberts who also declared that former First Lady Michelle Obama isnt fit to clean to clean her toilet. [] Melania has her priorities straight and she is a great example for our young women Julia Roberts said. Michelle? Talk about a wolf in sheepskin. Your News Wire has previously published articles falsely claiming that Denzel Washington called Barack Obama the criminal-in-chief that Morgan Freeman said that Hillary Clinton should be in jail and that Keanu Reeves admitted that Hollywoods elite regularly drinks baby blood. The view that Michelle Obama isnt fit to clean Melania Trumps toilet seems out of line with Julia Robertss known political views. She appeared at a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton Donald Trumps main political opponent during the 2016 election and helped raise money for Obamas re-election in 2012.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 14 September 2017 the prank web site BreakingNews365.net generated a false report that the makers of Reeses Peanut Butter Cups were to end production of the iconic candy and withdraw them from circulation by October 2017. We received several enquiries about this from readers: The announcement was released late on Friday Sept 8th in a press conference that the famous candy the original Reeses peanut butter cups would no longer be available! By October 2017 they will all be removed from the shelves! Manufacturer said due to the new versions and a severe decline in sales. It is no longer justifiable to continue producing the product. Originally there were plans to keep them through Halloween however those plans have fallen through. We say goodbye to a candy icon. RIP Reeses peanut butter cups. Make sure to get you one before they are gone! BreakingNews365.net and the related website BreakingNews247.net are prank generators that allow users to create fake headlines and articles and even fabricate the number of times their prank article has been shared on Facebook. No story on these web sites (or Facebook posts that link to them) should be taken for real news. The Hershey Company which manufactures the product has made no such announcement. Like everything else on BreakingNews365.com this story is fabricated. Reeses Peanut Butter Cups rank as the largest-selling candy in the United States. Between 20 and 26 August 2017 for example U.S. consumers bought more than $47 million worth of the product around $8 million more than the closest competitor M&M Peanut. Setting aside the fact that the manufacturer of Reeses Peanut Butter Cups has not announced the demise of the product the article bears some of the hallmarks of fake news: the manufacturer is not named; no location is given for the press conference; no representative of the company is named; a quote purportedly taken from a press conference is not attributed to anyone; and the article is poorly written featuring inappropriate exclamation marks missing words and grammatical mistakes.,,0,0,,

Jones recently revealed that chemotherapy doesnt work 97% of the time and doctors only recommend it to get kickbacks. See Example( s ) EXAMPLES Collected via e-mail June 2016 According Peter Glidden chemotherapy fails to work 97% of the time. Also he claims that oncologists can pocket close to $4000 for prescribing chemotherapy to one patient. False RATING False ORIGIN In June 2016 several alternative health and conspiracy blogs published posts claiming that a Berkeley doctor had recently blown the whistle on chemotherapy as a treatment for cancer revealing that it doesnt work 97% of the time and is only recommended due to practitioner greed (i.e. oncologists get kickbacks from suppliers). Most of those posts featured a video published to YouTube under the title Chemotherapy Does NOT Work 97% of the Time and Kills 97% of the Time a five-minute clip featuring a conversation between an interviewer and naturopathic physician Peter Glidden (in which the latter misrepresented a study to claim that chemotherapy kills an average 97% of cancer patients) and cited the work of a Dr. Hardin Jones: One aspect of note is that the clip was published to YouTube in May 2014 but identical blog posts trumpeting it as a bombshell showing a doctor blowing the lid off the scam of chemotherapy werent published by AnonHQ and RealFarmacy until 8 June 2016 and 10 June 2016 respectively: People who refuse chemotherapy treatment live on average 12 and a half years longer than people who undergo chemotherapy says Dr. Jones. According to recent statistics approximately 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women will develop cancer in their lifetimes. This saddening reality is made worse when it is acknowledged that modern methods of treating the disease are often ineffective and only make the symptoms of the disease worse. In fact according to one Berkeley doctor chemotherapy doesnt work 97% of the time. In the eye-opening video above Dr. Hardin B. Jones a former professor of medical physics and physiology at the University of California Berkeley discusses how leading edge cancer treatment is a sham. He has personally studied the life expectancy of patients for more than 25 years and has come to the conclusion that chemotherapy does more harm than good. The bone-chilling realization prompted Dr. Jones to speak out against the billion-dollar cancer industry. People who refused chemotherapy treatment live on average 12 and a half years longer than people who are undergoing chemotherapy said Dr. Jones of his study which was published in the New York Academy of Science. People who accepted chemotherapy die within three years of diagnosis a large number dies immediately after a few weeks. According to the physician the only reason doctors prescribe chemotherapy is because they make money from it. Such an accusation doesnt seem unreasonable as cancer treatment runs on average between $300000 $1000000 per treatment. Is any of this true? First off as David Gorski wrote for Science-Based Medicine such claims about chemotherapy by alternative medicine practitioners and aficionados are quite common and are typically misleadingly based on cherry-picked statistics misunderstandings (or misrepresentations) of how chemotherapy works and a focus on chemotherapys very visible drawbacks rather than its (less-obvious) successes: If theres one medical treatment that proponents of alternative medicine love to hate its chemotherapy. Rants against poisoning are a regular staple on alternative health websites usually coupled with insinuations or outright accusations that the only reason oncologists administer chemotherapy is because of the cancer industrial complex in which big pharma profits massively from selling chemotherapeutic agents and oncologists and hospitals profit massively from administering them. Usually they boil down to two claims: (1) that chemotherapy doesnt work against cancer (or as Ive called it before the 2% gambit) and (2) that the only reason its given is because doctors are brainwashed in medical school or because of the profit motive or of course because of a combination of the two. Of course the 2% gambit is based on a fallacious cherry picking of data and confusing primary versus adjuvant chemotherapy and chemotherapy does actually work rather well for many malignancies but none of this stops the flow of misinformation. Chemotherapy not surprisingly is easy to demonize. There are few treatments that cause such odious side effects and when taken to its fullest extreme such as complete ablation of a cancer patients bone marrow in preparation for a bone marrow transplant chemotherapy can be brutal. Its also true that for advanced solid malignancies it only tends to produce palliation or a prolongation in survival not a cure and people with cancer want a cure. Palliation just isnt that appealing for obvious reasons. When people think of chemotherapy they think of hair falling out nausea and vomiting fatigue and death. Since chemotherapy is often given for more advanced malignancies its sometimes hard to tell how many of these symptoms (other than the hair loss) are due to the cancer and how much they are due to side effects of the chemotherapy and many people incorrectly blame chemotherapy for the deaths of their loved ones with cancer. Also because like radiation therapy chemotherapy is often given in the adjuvant setting (i.e. in addition to curative surgery in order to decrease the risk of recurrence and death) its very easy to produce stories in which people with cancer refuse chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy after surgery and attribute their survival not to the conventional therapy (surgery) but to whatever quackery they chose to use. When used in early stage cancer although its relative efficacy can seem large for example a 30% decrease in the risk of dying if the risk of dying of cancer is only 10% to begin with thats only a 3% survival benefit on an absolute basis. In reality the use of alternative medicine instead of effective treatment for cancer where its been studied is always associated much poorer survival even in pancreatic cancer for which conventional treatments dont do so well. Still among the treatments in the cut poison burn terminology that believers in alternative medicine like to use to describe conventional cancer therapy it is the poison that causes the most fear and is most viciously demonized in the alt-med literature. As well the key information that none of these alternative health sites presented regarding Dr. Hardins statements on the efficacy of chemotherapy was that they were based on work published in the Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences way back in 1956 and a paper (not a study) titled A Report on Cancer that he presented at a science writers conference on 7 March 1969. All of this material is fifty to sixty years out of date and Hardin himself passed away in 1978 so even if he had researched cancer and chemotherapy until his dying days all of his findings would now be upwards of forty years old. In the field of medical science thats a huge time difference as exemplified by the plethora of now standard medical technologies that didnt emerge until 1978 or later: in vitro fertilization MRI machines the identification of HIV hepatitis vaccines the first draft of the human genome etc. But even back in the 1950s and 1960s Dr. Hardins conclusions were highly questionable due to his use of old and flawed studies as their basis: Hardin Jones was working with data from very early in the last century mainly from four studies containing the remarkable numbers of 651 100 64 and 100 untreated breast cancer patients along with a treated group. These were published in 1926 (!) 1937 (no reference given) and 1937 respectively. With the advanced cancers generally treated in those days it is likely that most of these patients would be incurable even today. None of the studies he examined were properly controlled trials. Well-planned clinical studies of any kind were still rare in those times and it would also have been quite unethical even then to randomise very destructive cancers to a no treatment group as demanded by any reliable comparison of treated with untreated patients. Where then did the untreated patients come from? They were those who refused operation or who had already advanced to an inoperable state. There are innumerable possible misleading influences in such studies. Moreover our understanding of cancer and its treatment has advanced greatly since Dr. Hardins days. Although what he said sixty years ago may have had at least some element of supportable plausibility to it that information is now woefully out of date and has been supplanted by additional research and a superior understanding of cancer that has been developed in the last several decades: Hardin Jones views (the documented ones as opposed to the alleged ones) were actually not far off the planet once he is placed in the context of his times. It happens that in the late fifties and early sixties there was some therapeutic nihilism in relation to the treatment of cancer especially breast cancer [on which he focused]. Despite numerous trials of different surgical operations for breast cancer with and without radiotherapy survival rates stayed frustratingly much the same (chemotherapy was still in its infancy and not mentioned at all in [his 1956 paper] another area where truth seems to have been dealt with rather loosely). In addition death rates of treated breast cancer patients did not seem to level out at those of the normal population at five or even ten years as might be expected if patients surviving for that long were likely to be then cured. Hardin Jones used this and other data to build a whole statistical theory proposing that the death rate for all kinds of cancer remains nearly fixed from the moment when cancer is identified It was becoming apparent to oncologists that breast cancer could metastasise (spread to distant parts of the body) much earlier than generally thought and that rather unusually among cancers the tiny occult (hidden) metastases could remain dormant for years before making themselves known. Breast cancer patients thus had to be followed up for very much longer than the usual five or ten years before they could be pronounced cured and on the data available at that time it was difficult to know how many were being permanently cured. The biology of the disease rather than the treatment appeared to be the main determinant of survival. While Hardin Jones was part right his data and his overly pessimistic views are very much a product of his times. One obvious indication of this is that the overall five year survival from breast cancer in the studies he examined was a dreadful 25% whereas NCI statistics for 2002 give an overall (all comers) five year survival of about 80%. Some of this difference will be simply due to lead time bias (i.e. longer survival simply due to most cases being diagnosed earlier in the course of their illness but it illustrates the very different times. Finally although chemotherapy undeniably causes bad side effects in many cases doesnt work well for some forms of cancer and may be over-recommended by some practitioners its benefits (especially in cases of breast cancer) are undeniable:,,0,0,,

In the city of Tokyo (Japan) the first restaurant in the world that legally offers Humana meat was inaugurated. A scary restaurant nicknamed The Resoto ototo no shoku ryohin which means in English Edible Brother opened its doors to the Japanese public and from all over the world where it offers its customers a varied menu where prices vary from 100 up to 1000 euros that is to say the dish with human flesh more expensive would be 1193 US dollars. International news sources have reported that a tourist from the country of Argentina was the first man to eat human flesh in the Edible Brother. This diner I think the following: It seems like eating pork in this restaurant they cook the meat with spices so the taste goes unnoticed. In Japan since 2014 a law was approved that allows the consumption of human flesh obviously conserving conditions such as the sanitary level of this and the origin. However there is no doubt that at least 99% of the world population would not agree with these grotesque acts so to speak. And the question we all ask ourselves how do they get the meat? The people before dying decide to sell their bodies to the peculiar restaurant approximately for about 30 thousand euros or 35799 dollars this is the balance that those interested can leave their families logically they are the only ones who can claim the money. Only people who die young can sign the contract in which they are subject to a special diet where the meat is suitable for consumption.

False RATING False ORIGIN On 7 April 2017 the web site USA Politics Today published a report followed by a series of posts from questionable web sites saying that the United States Supreme Court had ruled it illegal for U.S. schools to teach Sharia law: The Supreme Court of the United States just sided with President Trump in a landmark case the mainstream media hasnt been reporting on. On behalf of Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education Trumps legal team has petitioned the court to make America safer starting with our children. In a 5-3 decision that wasnt a difficult interpretation of the constitution the high court ruled that public schools in this country will NOT teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia law. In reality the high court has not considered the matter of Sharia law a set of Islamic religious principles that various scholars and governments interpret differently. Sharia or the fear of it has been the subject of several anti-Muslim claims including one stating that President Donald Trump had banned it nationwide. Following Justice Neil Gorsuchs appointment to the court on 10 April 2017 some versions of the story falsely cast him as the decisive vote in a 5-4 ruling on the issue. These versions also tended to include a statement in all-caps from his supposed first opinion for the court: THE GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY HAS NO BUSINESS BEING INVOLVED IN RELIGION BUT THIS ISNT A GOVERNMENT ISSUE OR A RELIGIOUS ISSUE. THIS IS ABOUT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH INTERPRETING THE LAWS AS THEY APPLY TO THE TEACHING OF RELIGION. WE SHOULD [sic] BE TEACHING ANY RELIGIONS IN THIS COUNTRY BESIDES STANDARD JUDEO-CHRISTIANITY AS OUR FOUNDERS WANTED AND WE CERTAINLY SHOULDNT BE FILLING THE CHILDREN WITH LIES ABOUT ISLAM BEING A RELIGION OF PEACE WHEN THEY SEE THE CARNAGE ON THE NEWS ALMOST EVERY DAY. IT IS OUR DUTY AS AMERICANS FIRST AND JUDGES SECOND TO SAFEGUARD THE WAY OUR CHILDREN ARE INDOCTRINATED. Gorsuch who was appointed by Trump did not cast his first vote until 20 April 2017 when he joined four other justices in denying a stay of execution to Ledell Lee an Arkansas man who was sentenced to death for killing a woman by strangling her in 1993. On 9 May 2017 the Federalist Tribune web site published another version of the story based on the equally false claim that the high court ruled on a complaint by the Volusia County Republican Party in Florida. There was no such case. But the group did promote an online petition a month earlier criticizing the Department of Education for allowing school districts to use the documentary series Access Islam as a learning tool. The petition stated: Public schools would never have students reading the Bible asking them to interpret scripture demanding they use biblical scripture in their daily lives have them examine what Christians say during prayer or instruct them to understand the Christian proclamation of faith. Access Islam is unconstitutional and should be dumped immediately by the U.S. Department of Education. But the program which was created using federal funding in 2005 is not required viewing in Florida schools. We contacted both the Department of Education and WNET-TV (which co-produced the series) seeking further comment but had not received a response by press time.,,0,0,,

She had all the typical symptoms of a pregnant woman. Its not the first time a young woman falls pregnant without the consent of her parents but the girl seemed sincere when she said she had never had sexual relations with a boy and she urged me to check her hymen which I eventually did and to my utter surprise the hymen was fully intact. It is impossible she has been impregnated by male sperm she assures. In my 26 years of practice I have never heard once of such a thing as someone being impregnated by a vaccine but I did some research and found out it is more common than most people think. On 23 September 2015 the web site(WNDR) published an article titled Texas: 14-Year Old Virgin Falls Pregnant After Flu Shot which reported that: The claim cleverly layered the suggestion of a falsehood within its own fabrication to facilitate the spread of the story. Due to that sleight of hand readers surmised the girl had lied about her sexual experience and had blamed the flu vaccine to deflect suspicion about the true nature of her pregnancy.

However the source cited by the web site was World News Daily Report a well-known peddler of fabricated news. On 6 February 2016 that web site& had published the claim just ahead of the 7 February 2016 football championship event: San Francisco CA | The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is concerned about an estimated 300000 pounds of counterfeit rat meat that has been sold as chicken wings in restaurants and grocery stores across America. FDA inspectors raised concerns when several illegal containers originating from China were seized by customs at the Port of San Francisco and were found to contain rat meat that was meant to be shipped to different meat processing plants across America and resold as chicken the FDA warns an estimated 300000 pounds of the counterfeit rat meat might still be in circulation and could finish in American plates during the Super Bowl this Sunday. The Super Bowl is a period where chicken wings are in high demand and where restaurants and grocery stores often face a penury explains FDA inspector Ronald Jones. This is where the illegal market comes in. Although there is nothing dangerous about consuming rat meat if it is properly cooked United States laws prohibit the import and sales of rat meat as a comestible item he adds. As with all of World News Daily Reports articles the claim had no basis in truth. The article used an unrelated image published to the internet in 2014 itself unrelated to chicken wings or the 2016 Super Bowl. The chicken wings are rat meat claim was swiped in 2017 by the fake news site Now44News.

Worse still the reporter actually coaches Nelson puts words in her mouth downplay the enormous significance of her deceit. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription ABC News tells us. But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbook ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence. Llamas also fails to ask any follow-ups such as If the explanation is this simple why wait all these weeks to offer it? Or Why did you lie? Nelson is accusing Moore of attempting to assault her when she was just 16-years-old. With the election just four days away this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for Moore. Nelson and Allred are planning a news conference Friday but nothing will overcome the forgery admission. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama. Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. Now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore. One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfmans living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. Thanks to New Medias going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moores office on business. If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an unfit absent and unstable mother. If the media and the accusers and Gloria Allred told the full truth to begin with they would all be more credible. As far as the accusations against Moore involving his wanting to date teenage girls those are trumped-up charges utter nonsense. The age of consent in Alabama was and is 16. Moreover 40 years ago it was not at all uncommon in the South for a 32-year-old man to seek a much younger bride. So not only did Moore not break the law he was not violating any social mores.

False RATING False ORIGIN In a hotly-contested December 2017 special election for an open U.S. Senate seat in Alabama Doug Jones edged out Republican candidate Roy Moore by the slim margin of about 21000 votes in an election that saw more than 1.3 million ballots cast. Moore decline to concede as his campaign said they wanted to hold out and see if provisional and overseas ballots counted later would close the vote gap. (The Alabama Secretary of States office later said they received 5333 such ballots not nearly enough to overcome Jones margin of victory.) The day after the election the Ladies of Liberty web site published an article reporting that Jones had received over 5000 votes in an Alabama town whose voting population was only about 1800 with the discrepancy attributed to ballots being cast in the names of dead people: The State Election Board of Voting Integrity said early on that more than a third of Jones votes up to 11 a.m. looked suspicious and with good reason. Many of them came from the small town of Bordalama a rural community about 20 miles outside Birmingham. According to official tallies Roy Moore received 953 votes in the small town. Doug Jones received 5327. If the disparity in numbers isnt enough to give you reason to smell something fishy the population of the town should. There are 2256 residents there and only 1867 registered voters. In other words more people voted for Doug Jones than even live in Bordalama. According to city records Reddit user MAGA4Ever points out there are 3460 people buried in the local Mount Peace Cemetery the exact difference between Moore votes and registered voters. A follow-up article published on the reaganwasright.com web site soon afterwards held that a total of more than 12000 ballots cast for Jones had been traced to voters who were no longer among the living: Ladies of Liberty reports that the small town of Bordalama Alabama was beset by fraudsters who apparently posed as dead people bringing the vote totals to 953 for Roy Moore and 5327 for Democrat Jones. There are only 1867 registered voters in Bordalama. In addition Jones was caught red-handed campaigning at a polling location and authorities apprehended a van full of illegals that was traveling from polling place to polling place voting for Jones. Now more dead folks have been found voting for Jones this time in Birmingham. State election officials have determined that more than 12000 votes (thats 5329 more than yesterday) so far in the state of Alabama are null and void because the voters dont appear to be living local news station WYKY reported Wednesday. It appears that these voters names were never removed from the rolls when they passed away and someone used their information to stack votes for Doug Jones. Both of these reports were false. They were nothing more than fabrications originating with two web sites belonging to a network of clickbait fake news outlets bearing identical disclaimers identifying their content as fiction:,,0,0,,

The Cuban authorities spotted the ship for the first time on May 16 near a restricted military zone west of Havana. They made many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the crew and finally mobilized three patrol boats to intercept it. When they reached it they were surprised to find that the ship was actually a nearly 100-year old steamer identified as the Cotopaxi a name famously associated with the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. There was no one on board and the ship seemed to have been abandoned for decades suggesting that this could actually be the tramp freighter that disappeared in 1925. An exhaustive search of the ship led to the discovery of the captains logbook. It was indeed associated with the Clinchfield Navigation Company the owners of the SS Cotopaxi but hasnt brought any clue concerning what happened to the ship over the last 90 years. Cuban expert Rodolfo Salvador Cruz believes that the captains logbook is authentic. This document is full of precious information concerning the life of the crew before the ships disappearance but the entries stop suddenly on December 1 1925. On 29 November 1925 the SS Cotopaxi departed Charleston South Carolina and headed towards Havana Cuba. The ship had a crew of 32 men under the command of Captain W. J. Meyer and was carrying a cargo of 2340 tons of coal. It was reported missing two days later and was unheard of for almost 90 years. The Vice President of Council of Ministers General Abelardo Colom announced that the Cuban authorities were going to conduct a thorough investigation to elucidate the mystery of the ships disappearance and reappearance. It is very important for us to understand what happened says General Colom. Such incidents could be really bad for our economy so want to make sure that this kind of disappearance doesnt happen again. The time has come to solve the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle once and for all. The Bermuda Triangle is a loosely defined region covering the area between Miami Puerto Rico and Bermuda where dozens of ships and planes have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Popular culture has attributed many of the disappearances to paranormal and supernatural phenomena or to the activity of extraterrestrial beings. One explanation even pins the blame on leftover technology from the mythical lost continent of Atlantis. Despite the popularity of all these strange theories most scientists dont even recognize the existence of the Bermuda Triangle and blame human mistakes and natural phenomena for the disappearances. The mysterious reappearance of the SS Cotopaxi has however already generated a lot of interest in the scientific community and could push some experts to change their mind on the subject.,CLAIM Early in Americas history white Irish slaves outnumbered black slaves and endured worse treatment at the hands of their masters. Mixture RATING Mixture WHATS TRUE Like impoverished people of other nationalities many emigrated from Ireland to the Americas in the 17th and 18th centuries as indentured servants; a smaller number were forcibly banished into indentured servitude during the period of the English Civil Wars; indentured servants often lived and worked under harsh conditions and were sometimes treated cruelly. WHATS FALSE Unlike institutionalized chattel slavery indentured servitude was neither hereditary nor lifelong; unlike black slaves white indentured servants had legal rights; unlike black slaves indentured servants werent considered property. ORIGIN A facet of U.S. history largely unfamiliar to Americans themselves is the role of indentured servitude in the survival and growth of the original 13 colonies. The earliest settlers needed laborers but only wealthy people could afford passage to the New World. This led to a system whereby those who lacked means were brought from Europe under contract to work off their passage room and board over a period of two to seven years until they were considered to have earned their freedom. No fewer than half of the immigrants who came to the New World during the colonial period arrived as indentured servants. Among the many thousands of impoverished Europeans brought over in this fashion were men women and children from England Ireland Scotland Germany and elsewhere but over the intervening centuries the notion has arisen that the Irish in particular were shipped to the New World as white slaves. In fact according to an article first published on the Internet in 2008 and endlessly recirculated since Irish slaves were not only common in early America they were more common than African slaves and often treated more harshly. The article making these claims is usually credited to an individual named John Martin who in turn found most of his facts in a 2003 article by James F. Cavanaugh called Irish Slaves in the Caribbean. It has gone by many names but as of mid-2016 the most shared version of the Irish slave narrative was entitled Irish: The Forgotten White Slaves and posted under the byline of a man named Ronald Dwyer. Regardless of who is or isnt credited with writing it nearly every iteration of the piece begins in exactly the same way: They came as slaves: human cargo transported on British ships bound for the Americas. They were shipped by the hundreds of thousands and included men women and even the youngest of children. Whenever they rebelled or even disobeyed an order they were punished in the harshest ways. Slave owners would hang their human property by their hands and set their hands or feet on fire as one form of punishment. Some were burned alive and had their heads placed on pikes in the marketplace as a warning to other captives. We dont really need to go through all of the gory details do we? We know all too well the atrocities of the African slave trade. But are we talking about African slavery? King James VI and Charles I also led a continued effort to enslave the Irish. Britains Oliver Cromwell furthered this practice of dehumanizing ones next door neighbor. The Irish slave trade began when James VI sold 30000 Irish prisoners as slaves to the New World. His Proclamation of 1625 required Irish political prisoners be sent overseas and sold to English settlers in the West Indies. By the mid 1600s the Irish were the main slaves sold to Antigua and Montserrat. At that time 70% of the total population of Montserrat were Irish slaves. Ireland quickly became the biggest source of human livestock for English merchants. The majority of the early slaves to the New World were actually white. Woven throughout is the implication that the reason so few Americans know anything about the so-called forgotten history of Irish slavery is that it has been excluded from biased history books. Indentured servitude vs. chattel slavery Limerick-based research librarian and historian Liam Hogan takes aim at this notion in a series of papers debunking what he calls the Irish slaves myth. There were no Irish slaves in the Americas Hogan says. People who claim there were are conflating indentured servitude with chattel slavery two distinct forms of servitude with more differences between them than similarities: White indentured servitude was so very different from black slavery as to be from another galaxy of human experience as Donald Harman Akenson put it in If the Irish Ran the World: Montserrat 1630-1730. How so? Chattel slavery was perpetual a slave was only free once they they were no longer alive; it was hereditary the children of slaves were the property of their owner; the status of chattel slave was designated by race there was no escaping your bloodline; a chattel slave was treated like livestock you could kill your slaves while applying moderate correction and the homicide law would not apply; the execution of insolent slaves was encouraged in these slavocracies to deter insurrections and disobedience and their owners were paid generous compensation for their loss; an indentured servant could appeal to a court of law if they were mistreated a slave had no recourse for justice. The race factor Hogan pins a 2014 resurgence of the Irish slaves narrative to increasing racial tensions within the United States situating it within a larger world view desirous of absolving white Europeans of blame for the transatlantic slave trade that brought an estimated 12 million Africans to the New World in lifelong bondage: From Stormfront.org a self-described online community of white nationalists to David Ickes February 2014 interview with Infowars.com the narrative of the White slaves is continuously promoted. The most influential book to claim that there was white slavery in Colonial America was Michael Hoffmans They Were White and They Were Slaves: The Untold History of the Enslavement of Whites in Early America. Self-published in 1993 Hoffman a Holocaust denier unsurprisingly blames the Atlantic slave trade on the Jews. By blurring the lines between the different forms of unfree labour these white supremacists seek to conceal the incontestable fact that these slavocracies were controlled by and operated for the benefit of white Europeans. This narrative which exists almost exclusively in the United States is essentially a form of nativism and racism masquerading as conspiracy theory. That the institution of chattel slavery in America was founded on race is undeniable. Beginning in the late 1600s the colonies all adopted slave codes which among other things routinely defined slaves as Negro or African according to the Encyclopedia Britannica: In all of them the color line was firmly drawn and any amount ofAfrican heritage established the race of a person as black with little regard as to whether the person was slave or free. The status of the offspring followed that of the mother so that the child of a free father and a slave mother was a slave. Slaves had few legal rights: in court their testimony was inadmissible in any litigation involving whites; they could make no contract nor could they own property; even if attacked they could not strike a white person. The Dred Scott decision handed down by the Supreme Court in 1857 reaffirmed that racialized definition of slavery. The 7 to 2 decision in Scott v. Sanford held that plaintiff Dred Scott a black slave did not qualify as an American citizen and had no standing to sue in federal court because in part persons imported as slaves had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order: In the opinion of the court the legislation and histories of the times and the language used in the Declaration of Independence show that neither the class of persons who had been imported as slaves nor their descendants whether they had become free or not were then acknowledged as a part of the people nor intended to be included in the general words used in that memorable instrument They had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order and altogether unfit to associate with the white race either in social or political relations; and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit. Mistreatment of the Irish In terms of historical accuracy the Irish slave story is a hodgepodge. For example the Proclamation of 1625 supposedly requiring all Irish prisoners to be sent overseas did not exist. You wont find it in any history books. There was a 1603 proclamation by James I ordering that rogues vagabonds idle and dissolute persons be banished and conveyed to places and parts beyond the seas etc. but this was not directed at the Irish in particular. It was put to use decades later in the wake of the English Civil Wars however as a justification for forcibly shipping thousands of Irish prisoners vagrants and orphans to the Caribbean as indentured servants. More than any other this historical fact inspired the notion that the Irish were enslaved. Still the text wildly exaggerates the number of those treated in this fashion falsely claiming that 300000 were sold as slaves. (Liam Hogan unravels these and similar statistical misrepresentations in A Review of the Numbers in the Irish Slaves Meme.) Words matter That thousands of Irish people were carried across the sea against their will and indentured to serve on plantations isnt disputed. It happened. Whats in question is whether or not they are rightly referred to as slaves. Some writers such as genealogist and Irish Times columnist John Grenham ask why not: The labor they did was slave labor and their circumstances were much worse than those of the indentured workers who traveled at the same time and later not least because indentured work though often harsh was voluntary and time-limited. Refusing to call them slaves is quibbling. Is it mere quibbling? Generically speaking any form of forced labor can be called slavery. But what do we gain by doing so besides blurring historical distinctions? Consider impressment the 18th-century British naval practice of kidnapping young men and forcing them to serve on sailing vessels. Thats slavery in a sense. So is being sentenced to hard labor in prison. But while these share features in common with the institution of chattel slavery in America they are on a whole separate plane. It isnt bias that keeps legitimate historians from substituting the term slavery for impressment hard labor or even forced indentured servitude. Its a simple respect for the facts.,,0,0,,

See Example( s ) EXAMPLES Collected via Facebook February 2016 Scam RATING Scam ORIGIN Scammers and malware purveyors are always looking for ways to entice online users into following web links that will lead those victims into the traps set for them and offers of free products are prime bait in that pursuit of prey. One common method such predators use is establishing fake Facebook accounts mimicking those of well-known vendors of consumer products (typically of the edible variety such as Starbucks Taco Bell McDonalds KFC Wendys Burger King Whole Foods Safeway Food Lion and Little Caesars) and posting bogus offers for lifetime passes or other dispensations of free product as part of a supposed company anniversary or birthday celebration (e.g. Starbucks is giving away free lifetimes in celebration of the brands 44th anniversary). The primary type of free product fraud is the sweepstakes scam which is intended to lure victims into completing numerous surveys disclosing a good deal of personal information and then agreeing to sign up for costly difficult-to-cancel Reward Offers hidden in the fine print. The scammers spread links via e-mail and Facebook that purport to offer free product to those who follow those links. These web pages (which are not operated or sponsored by the companies they reference) typically ask the unwary to click what appear to be Facebook share buttons and post comments to the scammers site (which is really a ruse to dupe users into spreading the scam by sharing it with all of their Facebook friends). Those who follow such instructions are then led into a set of pages prompting them to input a fair amount of personal information (including name age address and phone numbers) complete a lengthy series of surveys and finally sign up (and commit to paying) for at least two Reward Offers (e.g. Netflix subscriptions credit report monitoring services prepaid credit cards): Pursuant to the Terms & Conditions you are required to complete 2 of the Reward Offers from the above. You will need to meet all of the terms and conditions to qualify for the shipment of the reward. For credit card offers you must activate your card by making a purchase transferring a balance or making a cash advance. For loan offers you must close and fund the loan. For home security and satellite tv offers you must have the product installed. You may not cancel your participation in more than a total of 2 Reward Offers within 30 days of any Reward Offer Sign-Up Date as outlined in the Terms & Conditions (the Cancellation Limit). Not only that but the fine print on the free product offers typically states that by accepting its terms the user agrees to receive telemarketing phone calls and text messages from a variety of different companies: Similar phony free product lures are used to spread malware. In those versions of the scam those who attempt to reach the URL provided for the purpose of claiming the free products are instead victimized by a Facebook lifejacking attack a malicious script that takes over a users Facebook profile without their knowledge and propagates itself to their friends accounts as well. In short those who seek free merchandise generally end up paying a dear cost for it.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 29 October 2017 the disreputable web site Your News Wire published a fake news article which contained several (fictitious) quotes from actor Morgan Freeman about his (fictitious) desire to imprison Hillary Clinton: The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to send Hillary to prison according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman who warns that unless the former First Ladys crimes are seen to be punished everyday Americans will forever know deep down that there is one law for those with money and power and another for the rest of us. Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one and I mean no-one is above the law in the United States of America Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographics new docu-series The Story of Us. This is not a genuine quote from Morgan Freeman; YourNewsWire.com is a particularly vicious fake news blog that has a long history of publishing corrosive misinformation. The site claims that the actor made this comment while promoting his new documentary series The Story of Us during an event in New York but naturally provided no video from the event containing Morgans alleged remarks as none exists. Furthermore the Story of Us premiere was held on 28 September 2017 more than a month before Your News Wire published this article. It is possible that Freeman held additional promotional events (although it would be odd for the press tour to continue long after the premiere) but we could not find any news articles regarding a promotional event in New York for the series near this articles publication date. It is also unlikely that Freeman would ever suggest the idea that President Donald Trump should imprison Hillary Clinton. The actor openly supported of the Democratic candidate and even narrated several political ads for Clinton. Despite the fact that Morgan Freeman never said that Hillary Clinton should be imprisoned the fake quote was picked up by a number of disreputable sources such as the Punishers Patriot News Watch Facebook page and the web site nnettle.com. Actor James Woods also helped popularize this fake quote on Twitter. (Woods tweet has since been deleted.) Although Your News Wire used a fake quote as the basis for their article they did mention a genuine quote from Morgan Freeman in their concluding paragraphs. Freeman appeared in a video for the Committee to Investigate Russia where he asked Trump to tell us the truth:,,0,0,,

False RATING False WHATS TRUE H.R. 4919 would among other things have authorized federal grants to local agencies to fund the voluntary use of tracking devices to locate and safeguard patients with dementia or developmental disabilities (such as autism). WHATS FALSE The legislation did not pass and did not provide for ""microchipping"" anyone; in fact it specified that all tracking devices be non-invasive (i.e. non-implantable) and non-permanent. ORIGIN On 8 December 2016 the U.S. House of Representatives passed House Resolution 4919 (also known as Kevin and Avontes Law) a bill reauthorizing the Missing Alzheimers Disease Patient Alert Program a program that until it expired in 2013 provided federal grants to locally based agencies and organizations for the purposes of protecting and locating missing patients with Alzheimers disease and related dementia (with an added provision supporting the same services for missing patients with developmental disabilities such as autism). The bills sponsor Republican Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey explained the motivation behind it as follows (in part): Having worked with the Alzheimers and Autism communities for years I know how important this program can be in advancing the health and safety of persons who wonder as well as advancing awareness and education about the problem Smith said. What is shocking is that while almost half of all children with autism wander from safety only half of those affected families have received any guidance or training on addressing the concern and keeping their child safe according to a study published in Pediatrics. Smith said the funding can be used to provide proactive educational programming to prevent wandering and assist in locating missing individuals as well as innovative locative technology to help find those who may wander. According to the Alzheimers Association half of Alzheimers patients who wander will suffer serious injury sometimes fatal if not found within the first 24 hours Smith noted. This legislation will provide funding to law enforcement agencies and non-profits to help implement locative tracking technology programs for individuals with dementia/disability and implement a notification or communications system of alerts he said. After being approved by the House Smiths bill was sent to the Senate which adjourned for the year before acting on it. There was little controversial about H.R. 4919 apart from the authorization of tracking devices to monitor patients at risk for wandering. Not without good reason privacy concerns have always arisen when the phrase tracking device appears in government legislation. There are cases however when such concerns mushroom into full-blown paranoia. Often as in the present case this is due to the spread of misinformation. An article originally published on TrueActivist.com and subsequently reposted on other web sites including Anonymous News described a provision of H.R. 4919 as follows (emphasis added): Six years ago NBC Nightly News boldly predicted that all Americans would be fitted with RFID microchips by the year 2017. Though at the time NBCs prediction seemed far-fetched the House recently passed a bill that would bring a micro-chipped populace closer to reality before years end. Last Thursday the House passed HR 4919 also known as Kevin and Avontes Law which would allow the US attorney general to award grants to law enforcement for the creation and operation of locative tracking technology programs. Though the programs mission is to find individuals with forms of dementia or children with developmental disabilities who have wandered from safe environments it provides no restriction on the tracking programs inclusion of other individuals. The bill would also require the attorney general to work with the secretary of health and human services and unnamed health organizations to establish the best practices for the use of tracking devices. Those in support of the legislation maintain that such programs could prevent tragedies where those with mental or cognitive disabilities wandered into dangerous circumstances. Yet others have called these good intentions a Trojan horse for the expansion of a North American police state as the bills language could be very broadly interpreted. The suggestion that H.R. 4919 is simply a short step along the road from safeguarding dementia and autism patients to microchipping the entire populace and implementing a police state is based far more on alarmism than fact however. First it is not the case that NBC Nightly News predicted that all Americans would have RFID microchips implanted in their bodies by 2017 (we debunked this false rumor long ago). Second although the wording of H.R. 4919 may raise some legitimate discussion about privacy concerns it does not provide for microchipping anyone not people with Alzheimers not people with autism not the general populace. The bill clearly restricts the type of tracking devices to be used to ones that are non-invasive and non-permanent: Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act the Attorney General in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and leading research advocacy self-advocacy and service organizations shall establish standards and best practices relating to the use of non-invasive and non-permanent tracking technology where a guardian or parent in consultation with the individuals health care provider has determined that a non-invasive and non-permanent tracking device is the least restrictive alternative to locate individuals as described in subsection (a)(2) of section 240001 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14181) as added by this Act. Another paragraph defined the terms employed in the paragraph quoted above: The term non-invasive and non-permanent means with regard to any technology or device that the procedure to install the technology or device does not create an external or internal marker or implant a device or other trackable items. (Previous iterations of the law in effect through 2013 called for the use of simple ID bracelets.) Third while its true that the legislation calls for the U.S. Attorney General to consult with the Secretary of Health and Human services and leading research advocacy self-advocacy and service organizations to establish best practices for the use of such tracking devices its language again specifies that those devices be non-invasive and non-permanent. It also requires that the best practices include procedures to safeguard privacy criteria for establishing in each case that a tracking device is the least restrictive alternative to prevent harm to a patient measures for preventing abuse protection of the civil rights and liberties of the patient and a complaint and investigation process to address reported abuses of the program. Lastly the bill specifies that use of tracking devices is strictly voluntary and prohibits the federal government from establishing databases that gather information collected from such devices: Limitations on program (1) Data storage Any tracking data provided by tracking devices issued under this program may not be used by a Federal entity to create a database. (2) Voluntary participation Nothing in this Act may be construed to require that a parent or guardian use a tracking device to monitor the location of a child or adult under that parent or guardians supervision if the parent or guardian does not believe that the use of such device is necessary or in the interest of the child or adult under supervision. Kevin and Avontes Law was reintroduced to Congress at the end of 2017 as HR 4221. The Senate has passed it but the House of Representatives has not yet voted upon their version.",,0,0,,

That seems unimaginable in 2017 because for years the comedian has become known for angry and demented political rantings all hard-left of course up to and including theorizing that the September 11 terrorist attacks were an inside job. From The Federalist Papers So really it should come as no surprise that 2017 Rosie would see nothing wrong with openly attempting to bribe elected lawmakers to vote the way she wants but the spectacle is hilarious all the same.

I mean she hasnt exactly been A-list for quite a while And make no mistake this is illegal as all get-out according to 18 USC 201(b): Whoever (1)directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity with intent (A) to influence any official act; or (B) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing or collude in or allow any fraud or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud on the United States; or (C) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person; shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value whichever is greater or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years or both and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor trust or profit under the United States.

Dont be a homophobic sexual harasser too. https://t.co/U4cEM8Hhg0 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) December 20 2017 Because concepts like coherence and logic are lost on Rosie heres apparently the best she could muster in retaliation: Do you think Rosie knows Shapiro was a NeverTrumper?)

The courier company had no idea of her winnings. I knew something was wrong because I came back from lunch and the door to my office was closed said the manager. I slowly opened the door to discover the woman with her pants around her ankles hunched over on my desk like a hippopotamus/cheetah dropping a massive poo on my desk. There is no truth to the above-quoted story. The Valley Report is an entertainment web site that does not publish factual stories: Some of these stories may be exaggerated embellished or an outright work of fiction. Use proper judgment when reading anything on the internet. A common tactic among purveyors of fake news is to include a mugshot with the story to lend it some credibility. While these images typically show real mugshots (which are often regarded as fair game by fake news sites because they are at least nominally in the public domain) they are random photographs that are in no way related to the fake news stories and in fact the people depicted are probably unaware that their likenesses are now adorning often-embarrassing satire stories. In this case the woman pictured above was not arrested for defecating on her bosss desk.

But ODonnell thought she had a sure-fire way to convince several Republican Senators to vote against the bill and kill its chances of passing: she tried to bribe them. No really! The extremist left-wing nut jumped to her Twitter feed to offer a $2 million bribe to Senators Susan Collins and Jeff Flake to get them to vote the tax reform plan down. On Twitter ODonnell offered Collins $2 million in cash and helpfully added call if u want to negotiate. But even with the bribe ODonnell went on to personally attack the female Senator from Maine saying U have betrayed us all. Dear God. ask for forgiveness redeem ur soul tomorrow. Yes ODonnell write like an ill-educated teenager. The shrill ODonnell also went after Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona informing him that she already offered Sen. Collins the cash and now she was offering him the same amount. ODonnell said she would give them the cash If they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH. (She meany super rich not suoer rich. Unhinged AND cant spell. Its a nice two-fer.) The former TV host encouraged the two senators to DM her and added no shit 2 million cash each. Well she reiterated the bribe several times so she cant legitimately say she was joking. After all she DID say no shit. But as Daily Wire pointed out it is against federal law to offer bribes to U.S. senators to affect their votes. Indeed a violation of the law brings up to 15 years in jail if convicted. Here is the relevant section of 18 USC 201(b): Whoever (1)directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity with intent (A) to influence any official act; or (B) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing or collude in or allow any fraud or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud on the United States; or (C) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person; shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value whichever is greater or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years or both and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor trust or profit under the United States. Despite ODonnells spittle=specked tweets the U.S. Senate passed Trumps tax relief bill with a 51 to 48 vote (Arizona Sen. John McCain was not present to vote due to his ill health). The bill now goes back to the House of Representatives for a perfunctory final vote before going to President Trumps desk for him to sign into law.

Mostly False RATING Mostly False WHATS TRUE Police investigated a 2 June 2016 incident in Twin Falls Idaho involving a five-year-old girl and three boys aged seven ten and fourteen. WHATS FALSE The incident was not a rape the girl was not murdered the boys involved were not Syrian a knife was not used and no ""language barrier"" prevented police from investigating or detaining two boys involved. ORIGIN In June 2016 online outlets began reporting a rumor that three Syrian refugees had raped a 5-year-old Idaho girl at knifepoint that police were lax in investigating the case and that news media were refusing to cover the story: Proving a dangerous bias the media have remained eerily silent on the horrific events that occurred on June 2. In a shameless bid to protect their leftist agenda news outlets have given only vague details of the disturbing case however an outraged neighbor has come forward with the full story that is sure to put a damper on the federal refugee resettlement program. KMVT reported on June 7 that a sexual assault occurred near the Fawnbrook Apartment complex in Twin Falls Idaho. Only stating that no charges have been filed according to prosecutor Grant Loebs the station concludes that allegations are swirling on social media from an eye witness. Although theyve done well not to give any hint of who the perpetrators are why theyre being investigated or who the victim is a neighbor has broken the silence out of pure indignance over the authorities handling of the case. The boys are ages 13 10 and 8 and are Syrian refugee children from 2 families resettled in the apartments. What happened next is too sickening for mere words [A] neighbor states that the Syrian boys stripped the girl naked raped her and urinated on her body and in her mouth. Although the two younger boys were unable to perform sexually due to their ages the 13 coached the pair while he videoed the sexual assault after his own participation. The rumor made its way to a conspiracy-oriented web site whose headline on the topic blared: REPORT: THREE SYRIAN REFUGEES; RAPE LITTLE GIRL AT KNIFEPOINT IN IDAHO; Furious residents accuse council of cover-up. The headline made no mention of the ages of the refugees involved and asserted that police had declined to act due to a language barrier: Three Syrian refugees reportedly raped a little girl at knifepoint in Idaho before urinating on her body an incident that prompted furious residents to accuse Twin Falls city council members of covering up the assault. The little girl was playing outside Fawnbrook apartment buildings when the boys put a knife to her throat and forced her inside a laundry unit. She was then stripped naked raped and urinated on. The 13-year-old reportedly told the younger boys to urinate on her because they were incapable of ejaculating. The victims grandmother found the victim and then called the girls mother who called the police. The police took 2 and a half hours to arrive but were unable to take any action due to the language barrier. When she arrived the mother of the alleged rapists was only able to say no police while the father reportedly congratulated his 13-year-old son. Video of the entire assault was captured on the boys cellphone. A follow-up KMTV report revealed that the case has officially been sealed by a judge with no chance of it ever being unsealed since all parties involved are minors. A video of a Twin Falls council meeting shows irate residents demanding to know why council members have done nothing to address the alleged rape as well as numerous other issues involving Syrian refugees being housed in the area including hit and run incidents and Muslims spitting on non-Muslims. We contacted county prosecutor Grant Loebs to obtain first-hand information about the rumors. He confirmed to us that an incident did take place at the Fawnbrook Apartment complex in Twin Falls Idaho on 2 June 2016 involving a five-year-old girl a seven-year-old boy a ten-year-old boy and a 14-year-old boy. Loebs said that the three boys were of Middle Eastern descent but they were not Syrian and he had no information indicating they were refugees. Because the case is still being investigated and involves minors Loebs was unable to disclose many of its details. However he confirmed that police have indeed been aggressively investigating leads in the case observing all normal procedural practices rather than declining to act due to any purported language barriers. Officers have also interviewed the girl and all of the boys involved with the ten- and fourteen-year-old boys having been detained in juvenile custody during the ongoing investigation. Loebs told us there was no indication a knife was involved in the incident and that no one was raped or murdered (although contact of a sensitive nature allegedly occurred). Moreover he stated that the investigation was a police matter not one involving the local city council (which has no jurisdiction in criminal cases). Loebs subsequently provided much the same information to local news media: There were no Syrians involved there was no knife involved there was no gang-rape Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs said. His comments largely refute several differing accounts about the incident circulating on anti-refugee resettlement and conspiracy websites and anti-Muslim blogs. Most of those accounts claim a group of Syrian refugees sexually assaulted a mentally disabled girl at knife-point June 2 in the laundry facilities of Fawnbrook Apartments a low-income housing complex in Twin Falls and that the attack was celebrated by the perpetrators families as city officials orchestrated a cover-up. An incident did occur Loebs said and two juveniles have been charged after authorities obtained video shot on a cellphone. But the details of the case dont match whats being reported by anti-refugee groups the prosecutor said. There were no adults involved Loebs said the boys didnt have a knife and the incident wasnt a gang-rape instigated by the oldest boy. All those involved are juveniles and the older one didnt touch the victim in any way Loebs said. Only one person is alleged to have touched the victim said the prosecutor though he declined to elaborate. Various officials attributed the spread of much of the misinformation reported about the case to locals opposed to refugee resettlement in their area: Loebs said he didnt want to fan the flames of anti-Syrian refugee people but suspects the false reports are the work of a local group opposed to refugee resettlement who hoped to stir up trouble by claiming the incident involved Syrian refugees who committed a violent sexual assault. There is a small group of people in Twin Falls County whose life goal is to eliminate refugees and thus far they have not been constrained by the truth Loebs said. They have not been constrained by the truth in the past and I dont expect them to be constrained by the truth in the future. Loebs said sex cases between minors arent uncommon and implied that this case is being exploited by the local anti-refugee movement to make a political point. No Syrians have been settled in Twin Falls through Idaho refugee programs said Jan Reeves director of the Idaho Office for Refugees. There have been periodic website postings about hundreds of Syrians coming to Idaho that have all proven to be false in the past and this is probably just one of those attempts to try and stir up hatred and bigotry he said. Echoing statements by the prosecutor Zeze Rwasama director of the CSI Refugee Center said refugee opponents are trying to promote an agenda particularly against Syrian refugees. He asked residents to confirm facts and refrain from speculating online. It breaks my heart when people in the community are divided around issues of resettling refugees he said. Twin Falls Police Chief Craig Kingsbury later stated at a press conference that the boys involved were of Iraqi and Sudanese (not Syrian) descent that something a lot less serious than a sexual assault was initially reported to police and that none of the boys families were congratulating them following whatever took place: At a press conference in Twin Falls Chief Kingsbury addressed community members and the city council about the alleged assault and explained that two of the three boys involved in the incident are at a detention center following the alleged crime. The boys are reported to have been in the Twin Falls area for less than two years. The police chief also said there is no evidence to support claims the suspects fathers high-fived or praised the boys for committing the alleged assault as has been reported on anti-refugee websites. Further refuting claims made in the stories online that police bungled the investigation or tried to cover it up Loebs said the police investigated the incident thoroughly interviewed everyone who needed to be and followed proper protocols. Kingsbury also addressed claims that it took the police department more than two hours to respond. Simply that just is not true the chief said. The Twin Falls Police Department the Magic Valley Paramedics even the Twin Falls County Sheriffs Office responded in due time. Earlier in his comments Kingsbury said the call originally came in as something a lot less serious than a sexual assault or lewd and lascivious conduct. Chief Kingsbury was unable to confirm or deny if the boys are refugees. Multiple news outlets have indeed covered the incident and they have given only vague details of the disturbing case because its active status and the involvement of minors precludes officials from providing more detail: The criminal cases against those juveniles have been sealed as is customary when children are charged. Although prosecutors and police are barred from discussing certain details in sealed juvenile cases [NOTE: The photograph displayed at the head of this article is unrelated to this case and does not picture anyone actually involved in the reported incident.]",,0,0,,

The yearbook has been the source of immense controversy after her lawyer Gloria Allred refused to turn it over to forensic document examiners to verify its authenticity. She claims Moore did sign the book he just didnt write the note. According to Fox News: One of the women who accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of making advances on her when she was a teen and he a local prosecutor admitted Friday to writing part of the yearbook inscription she offered as proof a new crack in her story that gives Moore an opening to attack her credibility. Beverly Young Nelson now says part of the inscription near Roy Moores signature was not written by Moore. Beverly Young Nelson told ABC News she added the date and place in the inscription in her high school yearbook that she and famed attorney Gloria Allred presented as proof the then-30-something Moore sought an inappropriate relationship with her in the late 1970s. Nelson still insisted that Moore wrote most of the message and signed the inscription but said she made notes to it. Beverly he did sign your yearbook? ABCs Tom Llamas asked her. He did sign it she said. And you made some notes underneath? Llamas asked. Yes she replied. This blockbuster report is sure to give Moore a huge boost before the election Tuesday. Moore holds a slight lead over liberal Democrat Doug Jones.,"CLAIM The Burger King fast food chain ""admitted it has been selling burgers that contain horsemeat."" False RATING False ORIGIN On 5 September 2015 the notoriously unreliable web site Before Its News published an article stating that the Burger King fast food chain had now admitted after continuous denial that it has actually been selling UK customers both burgers and Whoppers that contain horsemeat: In a piece of highly disturbing news Burger King has now admitted after continuous denial that it has actually been selling UK customers both burgers and Whoppers that contain horsemeat. This admission comes just after The Guardian reports that Burger King reps offered a round of absolute assurances to customers that it did not ever use horsemeat in its products. A series of tests done on the burger products now reveal that Burger King has been issuing completely phony statements with burgers made for the fast food chain from the Irish company Silvercrest containing measurable levels of horsemeat. Its important to note this is the same company that processes meat for Tesco Asda and the Co-op. The managers at Silvercrest have been revealed to be utilizing non-approved ingredients within their burger assortment even for household brands. The Before Its News piece misleadingly linked to a nearly three-year-old article from the UK newspaper The Guardian referencing a controversy that began in late 2012 when subsidiaries of the ABP Food Group (including Silvercrest Foods and Dalepak Hambleton) were discovered to have been inadvertently been supplying beef products contaminated with horsemeat to retailers in Ireland and the UK. Although Burger King beef products were not targeted in contamination tests performed by Irish authorities at the time and the chain was not found to be serving burgers containing horsemeat the company quickly switched production facilities in order to ensure the safety and quality of their offerings: The fast food company whose products were not tested in the food standards checks by Irish authorities that sparked the furore moved production from the Silvercrest plant in Ireland to Germany and Italy as a precaution. [The company] said test results at the plant revealed very small trace levels of horse DNA in its products but burgers taken from restaurants had tested negative. As governments in Ireland the UK and Poland where a supplier used by Silvercrest for a year is thought be the source of the contamination continued their investigations Burger King admitted that contrary to previous assurances made to it by Silvercrest it too had now been linked to the scandal. Authorities insist there is no health danger to consumers. Burger King said: Our independent DNA test results on product taken from restaurants were negative for any equine DNA. However four samples recently taken from the Silvercrest plant have shown the presence of very small trace levels of equine DNA. Within the last 36 hours we have established that Silvercrest used a small percentage of beef imported from a non-approved supplier in Poland. They promised to deliver 100% British and Irish beef patties and have not done so. This is a clear violation of our specifications and we have terminated our relationship with them. In short Burger King stated back in early 2013 that trace amounts of horse DNA had been found at one of their suppliers plants but they had immediately discontinued use of that supplier as a precaution and no horse DNA had actually been found in the chains burgers. Nonetheless the disreputable Before Its News site deliberately misrepresented a nearly three-year-old story about a horsemeat contamination scandal that had barely touched Burger King to make it appear that the chain was now acknowledging they are currently selling horsemeat to customers who order hamburgers.",,0,0,,

Just a few weeks ago an Antifa affiliated camp was raided by police after they attacked a train in Washington during a fracking protest. They also targeted another train earlier this year. According to Gateway Pundit: Police have raided an Antifa encampment in Olympia Washington following a train being sabotaged by anti-fracking activists but the anarchists claiming credit for the act have vowed to continue until every officer is down. The train was reportedly shorted using jumper cables causing the train to stop. Since November 17 dozens of anarchists have been camping on the tracks to prevent trains from transporting fracking supplies from the Port of Olympia however railroad companies have stated that there were no such shipments scheduled. On Wednesday Union Pacific Railroad officers were met by 20 to 30 masked protesters as they cleared out the encampment and swept it for bombs. Four of the people who were camping on the tracks refused to leave and were subsequently arrested as were eight others on suspicion of obstructing a law enforcement officer. In addition to the November assault the Antifa group also attacked a train with concrete in April of this year. Here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on train tracks. We also include a how-to video at bottom of article:https://t.co/jToAfuL1vH pic.twitter.com/gUJdE2b9xL Official Antifa (@OfficialAntifa) June 28 2017 After that incident an Antifa webpage that was recently deleted even instructed people how to attack trains encouraging more people to do so. InfoWars was able to access a cached version of the page which said in part: We need a diverse and vibrant resistance composed of more forms of destruction mutual aid and solidarity than we can yet imagine. This action and actions like it are quite easy to do yourself. This only took a few hours and a little bit of planning. The hardest part was calming our nerves. Particularly easy was placing wire on the tracks to send a signal to the train company that the tracks were blocked. This action can and has been easily repeated wherever train tracks are. For more info on how to do this check out this explanatory video. Police have raided and cleared most of the #OlympiaBlockade. There are also reports that the train has left the Port. This is still a victory as we have cost the Port Halliburton and Rainbow Ceramics thousands of dollars the group bragged on Twitter.,CLAIM A Chinese coal miner was recently found alive in an abandoned mine 17 years after he had been trapped inside it by an earthquake. False RATING False ORIGIN On 8 May 2014 the web site World News Daily Report published an article reporting that a Chinese coal miner had just been found alive in an abandoned mine 17 years after he had been trapped inside it by an earthquake: A group of coal miners from the western province of Xinjiang had an unbelievable surprise when the gallery they were excavating opened up on a section of an old mine that was abandoned 17 years ago after an earthquake that caused some large sections of the tunnels to collapse. While they were exploring the galleries they stumbled upon Cheung Wai a 59-year old survivor from the 1997 accident obviously in a rather bad shape. He was immediately taken to the hospital where a complete evaluation of his physical and mental states will be done over the next weeks. Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this item were being circulated via social media with many of those who encountered it mistaking it for a genuine news article.

False RATING False ORIGIN On 31 January 2015 entertainment web site EmpireNews.net published an article reporting that the body of a homeless man discovered in San Diego had been found through DNA testing to be that of singer Elvis Presley: Earlier this month an 80-year-old homeless white-bearded man was found deceased under an overpass in San Diego California. Nobody knew the mans name but friends referred to him as Jessie so investigators decided to try DNA testing with hopes that something would pop up in the nationwide DNA database. What popped up on the computer screen in the high-tech lab stunned everyone. The DNA results of Jessie Doe were an exact match to the one and only Elvis Aaron Presley. Lab technician Robert Brensdale said he and his lab assistant Madeline Hedgespeth laughed when the name popped up. We thought somebody somewhere somehow in the system pulled the greatest and most elaborate prank on us ever we both laughed with hysteria for about an hour Brensdale told Jerry Hardin of the Hollywood Word a new entertainment publication based out of Los Angeles. Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However the report was just a spoof of the ubiquitous Elvis is alive and Elvis faked his death rumors that have circulated ever since the singer passed away in August 1977 accompanied by an artificial rendering of what an elderly Elvis might look like.

False RATING False ORIGIN On 5 May 2017 the The Last Line of Defense web site (and subsequently related shill sites such as USA Politics Now) published an article reporting that Malia Obama the daughter of former president Barack Obama had been arrested with a gang of thugs in Chicago on charges related to dogfighting: Malia Obama may have done irreparable harm to her career this morning when she decided to join a gang of thugs in Chicago for a day of drinking drugs and dogfighting at a public park in Chicago. Malia was arrested along with seven others and charged with wanton endangerment of animals public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance. She was found in the company of mostly older men when police arrived after being called by a concerned citizen complaining about a loud group of people watching dogs fight in the park According to the Secret Service Malia had slipped away late last night after being told open air parties at public parks were too dangerous. She wasnt seen again until she showed up in the 12th precinct jail. her parents havent been available for comment. In August 2017 the Land of the Free fake news site ran the same false story changing Malias alleged offense from a dogfighting-related one to a drug-related one: Apparently Malias weed habit has gotten worse because she was just caught in a massive marijuana bust in her home city of Chicago Illinois. Malia was caught buying weed edibles from two of her thug friends as well as enough pot to make thug rapper Snoop Dogg look like an amateur according to sources within Chicagos elite Drug Task Force. These reports of the former First Daughters arrest were completely fabricated and the image appended to them as proof that Malia Obama had been arrested in Chicago was a photograph of an October 2013 dogfighting ring bust which was digitally altered to insert a picture of her face in place of one of the original suspects: The Last Line of Defense (The Resistance) is a fake news site that consistently dupes social media users with fabricated stories despite the presence of a disclaimer disclosing its satirical nature: The Resistance may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that dont necessarily exist.

Around 3 am eastern time Yvette Prieto now widow of the star noticed that her husband showed no vital signs and she proceeded to call 911. Minutes after the paramedics arrived they confirmed the death of the athlete due to a heart attack. The wife Yvette Prieto said she feels devastated for the sudden death of his beloved husband and in a short speech to some news reporters she thanked them for all the support. She said that Jordan was a great person and everybody loved him. The web site also produced a video in order to lend some credibility to the claim that His Airness had died. Although the clip was designed to look like a breaking news segment the footage posted to YouTube was not anything broadcast by a credible news network: The dead giveaway that this video was a fake (and the report of Jordans death a hoax) came at the 25-second mark when reporter Rich Eisen appeared on screen to give a tearful goodbye to the sports legend. Although the footage of Eisen was real the sports reporter was not shown mourning the death of Michael Jordan; rather that portion of the clip was a recycled portion of an NFL Game Day broadcast from January 2015 which aired shortly after the death of Eisens fellow ESPN anchor Stuart Scott: ,,0,0,,

He then went on to star in the likes of Teen Wolf (1985) High School U.S.A (1983) Poison Ivy (1985) and Back To The Future (1985). This was the beginning of an incredible career for this unbridled talent. Michael J. Fox has been fighting Parkinsons disease since he was first diagnosed in the 1990s but hes tragically losing this fight. At 54-years-old Foxs speech is slurred and his left foot is so unresponsive that hes often forced to drag it behind him. He is expected to become wheelchair dependent before the age of 60. The often reclusive star took a night out with his wife Tracy Pollan in February of this year and required several helpers to enter and exit his vehicle. According to Radar Online a close friend said of the night out It was heartbreaking. Michaels bravery knows no bounds. But as the disease takes its toll on his body even he is beginning to see that his battle is a losing one. They continued to say Michael sees every day as a gift as well as an opportunity to help other sufferers. His Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinsons Research has done so much and has raised millions of dollars but a cure remains well out of reach. Michael may be down but hes not out. It was a struggle for him during his rare outing but as he headed away from the restaurant he even managed to flash a peace sign to his fans from the back of the limo. According to Snopes (because we wanted to verify this rumor) they said Despite his condition Fox has soldiered on with his acting career most recently starring as Mike Henry in NBCs The Michael J. Fox Show portraying a newscaster with Parkinsons who retires from work and also playing a recurring role on the CBS drama The Good Wife as Louis Canning an opposing counsel who suffers from tardive dyskinesia (involuntary visual tremors) and often uses his condition to his advantage by repeatedly calling attention to it in order to elicit sympathy during court appearances. One thing is certain: Michael J. Fox who in 2007 was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 people whose power talent or moral example is transforming the world has maintained his sense of humor and a forward outlook despite the difficulties of his medical condition. He has also been tireless in using the opportunities afforded by his high public profile to raise awareness of Parkinsons for other less visible sufferers. Please send your thoughts and prayers to one of our most beloved actors who continues to advocate awareness and the fight against Parkinsons disease.,"CLAIM Muslims were banned from immigrating to the United States in 1952 under the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See Example( s ) EXAMPLES Collected via e-mail December 2015 and January 2017 ISLAM WAS BANNED FROM THE USA IN 1952 but Obama & the media dont want you to know that. The Immigration and Nationality Act that passed June 27 1952 revised the laws relating to immigration naturalization and nationality for the United States. That act which became Public Law 414 established both the law and the intent of Congress regarding the immigration of Aliens to the US and remains in effect today. Among the many issues it covers one in particular found in Chapter 2 Section 212 is the prohibition of entry to the US if the Alien belongs to an organization seeking to overthrow the government of the United States by ""force violence or other unconstitutional means."" This by its very definition rules out Islamic immigration to the United States. This law is being ignored by the White House. Islamic immigration to the U.S. is prohibited under this law because the Koran Sharia Law and the Hadith all require complete submission to Islam which is antithetical to the US government the Constitution and to the Republic. All Muslims who believe that the Koran is lifes guiding principal also believe in total submission to islam & sharia law. To all who claim that Islam is a religion read the law again ... the law states that Aliens who are affiliated with ANY ""organization"" that advocates the overthrow of the U.S. government are prohibited. ts a law 8 US CODE 1182 WAS Used By Carter in 1979. Trump Wasnt Just Blathering Again. He has some SHARP PEOPLE working for him. Very interesting. Law of the Land...did you know this? Here is number 8 US Code 1182 inadmissible aliens. This law was written in 1952. It was passed by a Democrat controlled Congress House and Senate and signed by a Democrat president. ""Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by president. Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States the president may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate."" All of the pundits that are claiming that what Trump said is dumb stupid reckless dangerous and/or unconstitutional need to educate themselves. It is already the law of the land. And it was utilized by Jimmy Carter no less in 1979 to keep Iranians out of the United States but he actually did more. He made all Iranian students already here check in and then he deported a bunch. Seven thousand were found in violation of their visas 15000 Iranians were forced to leave the United States 1979. You probably wont hear of this from our mainstream media nor from our ""Imam-in-Chief"". But those are the facts. False RATING False ORIGIN In late 2015 a claim spreading on social media under the heading ISLAM WAS BANNED FROM THE USA IN 1952 holding that Muslims has been banned from entering or immigrating to the United States back in the early 1950s: ISLAM WAS BANNED FROM THE USA IN 1952 but Obama doesnt want you to know that nor does he respect or uphold US https://t.co/CzddJYISvu Doug Parks (@LDougParks) November 30 2015 The image sharply escalated in popularity following an unprecedented statement from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump who on 7 December 2015 (in the wake of a mass shooting in San Bernardino that had occurred five days earlier) suggested the United States should bar all Muslims from entering the country until such time as lawmakers could figure out what [was] going on Simply put the rumor maintained that Muslims as a group were ineligible for admission to the United States based upon a law that prohibited entry to any alien who belongs to an organization seeking to overthrow the government of the United States by force violence or other unconstitutional means. The law referenced was the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 also known as the McCarranWalter Act. Its text is available in full at the U.S. Citizenship and Naturalization Services (USCIS) web site where a preface indicates that the law has been amended many times over the years but is still the basic body of immigration law. The claim typically cited Chapter 2 Section 212 of the Act which excludes as ineligible for admission the following persons: In general any alien who a consular officer or the Attorney General knows or has reasonable ground to believe seeks to enter the United States to engage solely principally or incidentally in any activity a purpose of which is the opposition to or the control or overthrow of the Government of the United States by force violence or other unlawful means. That law originally aimed at Communists could be used now to exclude persons (both Muslims and non-Muslims) who have demonstrated an affiliation or sympathy with violent extremist groups professing Islamist motivations and goals (e.g. ISIS al-Qaeda Al-Shabaab Boko Haram) from entering the U.S. but asserting that it enables a de facto ban on all Muslims is inaccurate. Most major religions involve basic agreed-upon sets of tenets by which their faithful live and no widely-accepted understanding of Islam encompasses a prohibition on following the laws of any country or advocates the overthrow of government. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was not without critics among them President Harry S. Truman who vetoed the bill on 25 June 1952. In a letter titled Veto of Bill to Revise the Laws Relating to Immigration Naturalization and Nationality and addressed to the House of Representatives President Truman described the bills provisions as both antithetical to American values and discriminatory: The greatest vice of the present quota system however is that it discriminates deliberately and intentionally against many of the peoples of the world The desired effect [of selective admission of immigrants] was obtained People from such countries as Greece or Spain or Latvia were virtually deprived of any opportunity to come here at all simply because Greeks or Spaniards or Latvians had not come here before 1920 in any substantial numbers. The idea behind this discriminatory policy was to put it baldly that Americans with English or Irish names were better people and better citizens than Americans with Italian or Greek or Polish names. It was thought that people of West European origin made better citizens than Rumanians or Yugoslavs or Ukrainians or Hungarians or Baits or Austrians. Such a concept is utterly unworthy of our traditions and our ideals. It violates the great political doctrine of the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal. It denies the humanitarian creed inscribed beneath the Statue of Liberty proclaiming to all nations Give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. It repudiates our basic religious concepts our belief in the brotherhood of man and in the words of St. Paul that there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free . for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. In that letter President Truman further maintained the acts provisions were out of alignment with foreign policy goals inhibiting immigrants who needed it most from seeking safe harbor in America: The basis of this quota system was false and unworthy in 1924. It is even worse now. At the present time this quota system keeps out the very people we want to bring in. It is incredible to me that in this year of 1952 we should again be enacting into law such a slur on the patriotism the capacity and the decency of a large part of our citizenry. Today we have entered into an alliance the North Atlantic Treaty with Italy Greece and Turkey against one of the most terrible threats mankind has ever faced. We are asking them to join with us in protecting the peace of the world. We are helping them to build their defenses and train their men in the common cause. But through this bill we say to their people: You are less worthy to come to this country than Englishmen or Irishmen; you Italians who need to find homes abroad in the hundreds of thousands you shall have a quota of 5645; you Greeks struggling to assist the helpless victims of a communist civil war you shall have a quota of 308; and you Turks you are brave defenders of the Eastern flank but you shall have a quota of only 225! Trumans words seemed exceptionally prescient when he spoke of citizens in countries that had in recent years fallen behind the Iron Curtain: Today we are protecting ourselves as we were in 1924 against being flooded by immigrants from Eastern Europe. This is fantastic. The countries of Eastern Europe have fallen under the communist yoke they are silenced fenced off by barbed wire and minefields no one passes their borders but at the risk of his life. We do not need to be protected against immigrants from these countries on the contrary we want to stretch out a helping hand to save those who have managed to flee into Western Europe to succor those who are brave enough to escape from barbarism to welcome and restore them against the day when their countries will as we hope be free again some 30000 Rumanians who have managed to escape the labor camps and the mass deportations of their Soviet masters have asked our help. These are only a few examples of the absurdity the cruelty of carrying over into this year of 1952 the isolationist limitations of our 1924 law. In that letter President Truman spoke specifically of immigration quotas arranged deliberately to exclude specific nationalities. A large portion of the letter directly addressed Trumans belief that the American way of life ought to be extended to those living under the same totalitarian regimes the U.S. hoped to vanquish. Truman lamented that in no other realm of our national life are we so hampered and stultified by the dead hand of the past as we are in this field of immigration. The ISLAM WAS BANNED FROM THE USA IN 1952 claim proved popular following a period of increasing rhetoric similar to that which Truman decried as discriminatory and outdated in 1952. The basic claim hinged on the tautological assertion that adherence to Islam alone constitutes participation in an organization seeking to overthrow the government of the United States by force violence or other unconstitutional means.

This disaster killed several people on the train and injured several others according to Fake News CNN who note that the deaths are all contained to the train. According to the Washington Department of Transportation and Human Welfare something caused it to come off the tracks. It is unclear as of yet how many people were killed but what CNN isnt mentioning is that we do know what caused this accident and it was not an accident. Breitbart reports that police scanners at the time of the derailment cops were searching for a man of Middle Eastern appearance in the area who was seen walking away from the overpass from which part of the train hung for hours with passengers inside. Twenty minutes later Patrol Car 42 announced suspect apprehended. While no official report has been released chatter on the radio indicates that someone had placed a gold dollar on the track a trick anyone can learn from childrens television in an effort to derail the train. Traditionally a penny would be used but in 1949 the United Railway Association required changes in trains that would allow them to pass over a penny without derailing. A quarter is not thick enough but a Sacajawea gold dollar is. While we dont have an official confirmation that this was related to terrorism its not exactly normal for a Muslim man to be apprehended near the scene of a major disaster without it being terrorism is it?,CLAIM Malia Obama was fired from an internship at the United States Embassy in Spain (not the Spanish Embassy) after being caught smoking pot on the job. False RATING False ORIGIN On 29 June 2017 the unreliable web site FreedomCrossroads.us posted a report stating that former President Obamas elder daughter Malia was fired from a cushy internship at the United States Embassy in Spain for using drugs: How does an 18-year-old girl fresh out of high school who has been caught smoking pot more than the Bush twins were caught drinking land a job as an intern at the US Embassy in Spain? Privilege. Obama and his pals liked to call it white privilege but they really cant in this case can they? In this case the daughter of a president was moved to the front of the line. It didnt last long however because just like at home Malia has issues with staying out of trouble. She was caught by Embassy Security aka the US Marines on the roof of the building burning a doobie and playing with the Ambassadors carrier pigeons. Ambassador Bedard is an avid hobbyist. Malia was terminated immediately her room was cleared and she was escorted from the private areas of the embassy to the common area where she could wait to change the dates on her travel visa so she could return home. Although it was widely reposted and shared on social media as if factual the report is entirely fictitious. As it happens Malia Obama did work as an intern at the United States Embassy in Spain the previous summer (2016) but she was not fired from the job at that time nor did she return to it in 2017 so she couldnt have been fired from it then either. This year according to mainstream press reports Malia Obama completed a spring internship in New York City before vacationing with her parents overseas in June. The original source of the false report Freedom Crossroads bills itself as a satirical web site dedicated to lampooning conservative politics: We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey works of pure satirical fiction to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You wont find any of it here. Previous specimens of Freedom Crossroads bullhonkey include reports that barrels containing human remains were found on Bill and Hillary Clintons property and that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosis daughters were arrested for smuggling cocaine. Previous stories spread about the teenaged daughter of the former United States President include rumors that she had been arrested with a gang of thugs was expelled from Harvard and was pregnant when she was sixteen.

Mary Lynne Davies who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines. The revelation came after the yearbook inscription that Moore supposedly wrote in the 1970s turned out to be a forgery. Davies who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. Her attorney says she sticks by her story: My clients main concern is that because of the yearbook thing nobody will believe her story. She fabricated the yearbook because nobody would listen in the first place. Shes a victim and now shell be prosecuted while her abuser goes to the US Senate. Nothing about this is right. Nothing. Nothing about this is wrong jerk. Justice Moore is a fine upstanding man who has shown time and time again that he loves America and our family values. He deserves to be exonerated. The AG says hes also looking into charges against the other Moore accusers as well as the employees of that mall that said he was a pedophile. Moores attorney says there are no hard feelings and that his client will continue to fight for womens rights.,CLAIM Sahar Tabar has undergone 50 physical surgeries to make her face resemble that of Angelina Jolie. False RATING False ORIGIN A young Iranian woman was placed at the center of online controversy in November 2017 after several news outlets reported that she had had extreme plastic surgery in order to look like Angelina Jolie: The Belgian news site Sud Info reported that Sahar Tabar had undergone 50 plastic surgery operations in just a few months and had lost 40 kilos (around 88 pounds) in an effort to physically resemble actress Angelina Jolie. The story was quickly picked up by web sites in India Saudi Arabia and the U.S. among other countries. Although Sud Info listed Tabar as being 22 years old other sites have reported that she is only 19. While most reports on the subject relied on Tabars official Instagram account which has amassed 447000 followers another Instagram account using Tabars name rebuffed the allegations that she had experienced as many as 50 surgeries in a 28 November post that stated: Hello relatively dear followers the picture that youre scrutinizing even though I didnt like it I kept it in I must say I only had [indeterminate number of] surgery not 50 surgeries and foreign sites and channels were very biased in the way they talked about my photos. I thought these people are probably living in the 18th century and they havent seen or heard of technology or makeup and they are really surprised. Tabars mention of technology and makeup suggested that her photographs might have been digitally altered and/or that she achieved the unusual look on display in online images in part through through the application of cosmetics or prosthetics. Tabars post also asserted that those who have criticized her were merely displaying a show of jealousy and flames. Critics have maintained in comments posted to her social media accounts that Tabar is actually employing prosthetics in her photographs a suspicion she confirmed in an interview published by the Russian news outlet Sputnik on 4 December 2017. No of course. This is Photoshop and makeup. Every time I publish a photo I paint my face in an increasingly funny way. It is a way of expressing yourself a kind of art. My fans know that this is not my real face. According to Tabar she had only undergone three plastic surgeries: a nose enlarged mouth and liposuction. She also rebuked the idea that she set out to emulate Jolies facial appearance: Actually no. I did not even think about being like Jolie. Also I did not want to resemble the cartoon character Rotting Bride. Now I understand that I have something to do with them but I am a muse myself and remembering someone is not an end in itself. The many articles about Tabar leading up to her apparent confession did not contain any quote from a direct interview with her or a social media post from her affirming the number of surgeries she allegedly undertook her purported dieting or whether her actual motivation was to like the Academy Award-winning actress. A video posted by the British newspaper The Sun for example captures Tabar speaking Farsi but our translation of that video found in contained no mention of Jolie. Like other viral stories the report on Tabar had spread without much in the way of sourcing aided in part by her unique pictures.,,0,0,,

Scam RATING Scam ORIGIN Scammers and malware purveyors are always looking for ways to entice online users into following web links that will lead those victims into the traps set for them and offers of free airline tickets are prime bait in that pursuit of prey. Airline tickets are something nearly everyone uses and have considerable value but their non-material nature and the fact that theyre not tremendously expensive (compared to say a new car) makes it seem plausible to the public that theyre something a business might actually be giving away for free as part of an advertising promotion. Virtually every major U.S. air carrier including American Airlines Delta Air Lines Southwest Airlines Emirates United Airlines US Airways Continental Airlines Alaska Airlines WestJet Airlines Allegiant Air and Air Canada has been invoked in various online free ticket giveaway scams in recent years: The primary type of free ticket fraud is the sweepstakes scam which is intended to lure victims into completing numerous surveys disclosing a good deal of personal information and then agreeing to sign up for costly difficult-to-cancel Reward Offers hidden in the fine print. The scammers spread links via e-mail and Facebook that purport to offer free air travel tickets to those who follow those links. These web pages (which are not operated or sponsored by the airlines they reference) typically ask the unwary to click what appear to be Facebook share buttons and post comments to the scammers site (which is really a ruse to dupe users into spreading the scam by sharing it with all of their Facebook friends). Those who follow such instructions are then led into a set of pages prompting them to input a fair amount of personal information (including name age address and phone numbers) complete a lengthy series of surveys and finally sign up (and commit to paying) for at least two Reward Offers (e.g. Netflix subscriptions credit report monitoring services prepaid credit cards): Pursuant to the Terms & Conditions you are required to complete 2 of the Reward Offers from the above. You will need to meet all of the terms and conditions to qualify for the shipment of the reward. For credit card offers you must activate your card by making a purchase transferring a balance or making a cash advance. For loan offers you must close and fund the loan. For home security and satellite tv offers you must have the product installed. You may not cancel your participation in more than a total of 2 Reward Offers within 30 days of any Reward Offer Sign-Up Date as outlined in the Terms & Conditions (the Cancellation Limit). Not only that but the fine print on the free tickets offers typically states that by accepting its terms the user agrees to receive telemarketing phone calls and text messages from a variety of different companies: Similar phony free ticket lures are used to spread malware. In those versions of the scam those who attempt to reach the URL provided for the purpose of claiming the free tickets are instead victimized by a Facebook lifejacking attack a malicious script that takes over a users Facebook profile without their knowledge and propagates itself to their friends accounts as well. In short those who seek free merchandise generally end up paying a dear cost for it.,,0,0,,

Im not concerned about the lesson plan in history class we earn about other cultures outside our and and its important to have a solid knowledge of a topic before we decide to freak out based on misleading information. But the question is did the dad really did get banned and if there really is a lack of lessons on other religions in this school. This is circulating on Facebook. Mixture RATING Mixture WHATS TRUE A students father was banned from his daughters high school after he objected to a homework assignment she was given about Islam. WHATS FALSE Kevin Wood was not banned because of his objection to Islam but because he reportedly threatened to ""cause a disruption"" on campus. ORIGIN On 26 October 2014 a claim began to circulate online which stated a Marine was banned from his daughters school for objecting to a lesson about Islam. The parent in question was identified in the post as Kevin Wood father of a female student at La Plata High School in Maryland. According to Wood he learned of his daughters assignment despite an attempt on her part to conceal it from him: When Kevin Wood stopped by his daughters room and asked how she was doing with her homework she seemed to be hiding it from him. He took the papers and looked at them but what he found made him livid. Her world history class talked about Muhammad and the tenets of Islamic religion comparing it to Christianity but without allowing Christians to be heard. It indoctrinated the students with false ideas of Islam and did not give them a true picture. History is literally being re-written. Wood stated he was initially told his daughter would be given an alternate assignment but the school rescinded the offer: But later the Vice Principal of the school Miss Morris told them that if their daughter did not complete that original assignment she would receive a zero or an F. Outraged Mr. Wood told the school that he would be bringing the media in to the issue. The Vice Principal then contacted the court and filed a restraining order against Mr. Wood effectively banning him from coming to the school his daughter attends. After Woods claims circulated heavily on social sites like Facebook La Plata High School officials commented to a local news outlet about the situation. According to the school Wood was not banned over his objection to the assignment. On 23 October 2014 the schools principal filed for a no-trespass order against Wood. A representative for La Plata High School said the move was unusual and the parent had allegedly threatened to cause a disruption in remarks made to a vice principal: La Plata High School Principal Evelyn Arnold filed for a no-trespass order against Kevin Wood of La Plata Thursday Oct. 23. The assignment has been given for years said Katie OMalley-Simpson. This particular parent had a problem with the assignment last Thursday. It is unusual [to ban a parent from a school] she added. We dont file no trespassing charges lightly. We would only do that when we feel someone has threatened the safety of staff and students. Charles County Public Schools the district in which La Plata High School is located released a statement to parents about the situation: Charles County Public Schools (CCPS) social studies curriculum adheres to the Maryland World History curricular standards that are a requirement for all counties in the state. These standards include an analysis of the elements of culture such as art music religion government social structure education beliefs and customs in societies throughout history. Regarding the study of history specifically the standards also state that students should be able to analyze the customs and beliefs of world religions and their expansion as well as how their establishment has impacted other areas of culture and in certain times and regions even caused conflict. The particular unit in question at La Plata High School is on the formation of Middle Eastern empires in which students learned the basic concepts of the Islamic faith and how it along with politics culture economics and geography contributed to the development of the Middle East. Other religions are introduced when they influence or impact a particular historical era or geographic region. For example when reviewing the Renaissance and Reformation students study the concepts and role of Christianity. When learning about the development of China and India students examine Hinduism and Buddhism. There is also misinformation about why the school issued a No Trespass Order on a parent. This parent threatened to cause problems that would potentially disrupt La Plata High School this morning. To ensure the safety of students and staff at the school the school administration placed a No Trespass Order on this parent. A representative for the school stated none of the material in question was religiously indoctrinating in nature and the lesson on Islam was a part of a larger world history curriculum. In January 2016 the Thomas More Law Center announced that they had filed a lawsuit against the Charles County Public School on behalf of John and Melissa Wood:",,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN For nearly twenty years now Internet users have been immersed in warnings advising them to be wary of persons attempting to sell perfume in store parking lots: PLEASE PASS THIS ALONG TO YOUR WOMEN FRIENDS!!! I was approached yesterday afternoon around 3:30pm in the Wal-Mart parking lot at Forest Drive by two males asking what kind of perfume I was wearing. Then they asked if Id like to sample some fabulous scent they were willing to sell me at a very reasonable rate. I probably would have agreed had I not received an email some weeks ago warning of a wanna smell this neat perfume? scam. The men continued to stand between parked cars I guess to wait for someone else to hit on. I stopped a lady going towards them pointed at them and told her about how I was sent an e-mail at work about someone walking up to you at the malls or in parking lots and asking you to SNIFF PERFUME that they are selling at a cheap price. THIS IS NOT PERFUME IT IS ETHER! When you sniff it youll pass out. And theyll take your wallet your valuables and heaven knows what else. If it were not for this e-mail I probably would have sniffed the perfume. But thanks to the generosity of an emailing friend I was spared whatever might have happened to me. I wanted to do the same for you. PASS THIS ALONG TO ALL YOUR WOMEN FRIENDS AND PLEASE BE ALERT AND AWARE!! The scenario described above isnt a real danger. No one has reported having been robbed in this manner save for one woman in 1999 whose claim was suspect (for reasons we discuss below). This legend doesnt even describe a plausible scenario because despite what books and television shows may depict rendering a person unconscious from a mere sniff or two of some substance is not easy to do. Ether is nasty volatile stuff that requires a great deal more than a few brief inhalations to knock a person out. In fact its hard to think of any substance that could produce the instant unconsciousness described here. This legend appears to have begun in late 1999 with a widely-circulated Internet message that used one specific news report as a basis for implying that ether-wielding robbers were a potentially widespread menace: Watch out-this is for real! I just heard on the radio about a lady that was asked to sniff a bottle of perfume that another woman was selling for $8.00 (In a mall parking lot). She told the story that it was her last bottle of perfume that regularly sells for $49.00 but she was getting rid of it for only $8.00 sound legitimate? Thats what the victim thought but when she awoke she found out that her car had been moved to another parking area and she was missing all her money that was in her wallet (total of $800.00). Pretty steep for a sniff of perfume! Anyway the perfume wasnt perfume at all it was some kind of ether or strong substance to cause anyone who breathes the fumes to black out. SO Please beware Christmas time is coming and we will be going to malls shopping and we will have cash on us. Ladies please dont be so trusting of others and beware of your surroundings-ALWAYS! Obey your instincts! The incident described above was real in the sense that a Mobile Alabama woman claimed it happened to her on 8 November 1999 and reported the alleged robbery to the police but its false in that no evidence ever surfaced to verify her story. Bertha Johnson a 54-year-old Mobile woman maintained that at about 2:00 PM on Monday 8 November she had pulled into the parking lot of a bank when a woman approached her car and offered to sell her bottles of cologne that ordinarily retail for $45 for the low price of $8. Ms. Johnson says she sniffed a sample of the cologne and the next thing she knew it was around half an hour later she was standing with her keys in her hand at a wicker store two miles away from the bank her head was throbbing and $800 she had been carrying ($500 of her own money plus $300 of her employers) was missing. However her claim had some surface implausibilities: Ms. Johnson was allegedly robbed on her way into a bank. How did the robber know she had a significant amount of money on her? Not everybody walks into a bank with a wad of cash was the robber simply choosing random victims in the hopes of hitting on one who did? If so how come no one else has reported being the victim of such a robbery attempt? We have to assume that this is a brand new crime scheme and that the perpetrator hit the jackpot on the very first try (and apparently hasnt used it since). a bank. How did the robber know she had a significant amount of money on her? Not everybody walks into a bank with a wad of cash was the robber simply choosing random victims in the hopes of hitting on one who did? If so how come no one else has reported being the victim of such a robbery attempt? We have to assume that this is a brand new crime scheme and that the perpetrator hit the jackpot on the very first try (and apparently hasnt used it since). As Dr. Matthew Barnhill a toxicologist with the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences noted its difficult to imagine what substance could have been used to cause someone to pass out so quickly from a single sniff. Any drug or chemical that could immediately knock a victim out merely through his inhaling it (rather than ingesting or injecting it) would have to be quite potent indeed. We might also consider that Ms. Johnson was carrying money belonging to her employer at the time of the alleged robbery and that pretending to be robbed while carrying someone elses money is a classic theft scheme. As well when she allegedly came to following the assault she was not sitting in her car but standing up with her keys in her hand. Maybe she did regain consciousness in stages passing through a state similar to sleepwalking before becoming fully aware again. On the other hand waking up in a car isnt likely to draw much attention but showing up in a parking lot wandering around in a dazed state will almost certainly create a few believable witnesses who will remember having found a crime victim. Sure enough several weeks later the toxicology reports concerning tests run on blood and urine samples taken from Ms. Johnson immediately after the alleged attack did not indicate the presence of any unusual or abnormal substance in her system. The case remained officially open but this one smelled like a scam cooked up by Ms. Johnson to abscond with her employers money. Now in true urban legend fashion this tale has gone from a news report of an alleged victims unsubstantiated story to a general warning that this sort of thing might happen to you to a specific warning that this type of robbery is actually happening. It isnt happening though and it probably never did not even once. Its interesting to see how little occurrences that arent even part of the scenario described are now being reported as evidence of narrow brushes with these non-existent robbers. For example the following was prefaced to one e-mailed example: Some of you got this email some weeks ago like me. I just wanted to pass along that I was approached yesterday afternoon at around 3:30 p.m. in the Wal-Mart parking lot at Forest Drive by 2 males asking what kind of perfume I was wearing. I didnt stop to answer them and kept walking toward the store. At the same time I remembered this email. The men continued to stand between parked cars I guess to wait on someone else to hit on. I stopped a lady going toward them pointed at them and told her what they might ask and NOT to let them get near her. When that happened the men and a lady (I dont know where she came from!) started walking the other way toward their car parked in far corner of the parking lot. I thank Jane Shirey for passing this along it might have saved me from a robbery. Im passing this along to youall so you can warn the women in your life to watch out for this Now men asking passing women about the perfume theyre wearing isnt at all the same thing as crooks using rigged perfume bottles to knock out their victims. The fact is some companies (such as Scentura) do hire people to sell perfume door-to-door or in parking lots and some of these salespeople do indeed work in pairs pitch their wares from cars and employ aggressive sales tactics (which include approaching women and asking them what kind of perfume they have on). But now that this legend is circulating people dutifully report any sighting of perfume-selling strangers in parking lots as proof of this fictional crime wave of ether-bearing robbers being real. Indeed we routinely receive e-mails from women who have had encounters with folks vending perfume in parking lots and who have concluded (based on nothing but spurious rumor) that they were about to be robbed. They write to report were all wrong about this sort of robbery not taking place because hadnt they themselves almost had it happen to them? That no knockout potions were offered to them and no robberies (completed or attempted) took place does little to dissuade them from their certainty that they came within a hairs breadth of harm at the hands of some innocent freelance perfume sellers. We wrote the original article about this rumor in 2000. As far along as April 2006 Alabama police were still having to field reports on this non-existent form of crime and inform the public that its a hoax: Police are debunking as a hoax reports of a man trying to use ether to abduct a young girl outside Eastdale Mall. Capt. Huey Thornton said the report generated in an e-mail circulating throughout Montgomery is false. Thornton said the people named in the e-mail asserted their daughter was approached by a man outside the mall but that details of the e-mail have been significantly embellished. The e-mail states that investigators told the couple a man posing as a perfume salesman had asked other young girls to smell the perfume on his hand which turned out to be ether. The Montgomery Police Department is not familiar with any cases in the city where a subject matching the description in the e-mail has approached anyone posing as a perfume salesman or any cases where ether has been involved. Since 2000 (when we wrote our original article) weve been keeping our ears and eyes open for news of any instances of this sort of robbery happening in real life. So far the closest thing to arise is a July 2008 case in a town in Louisiana. In Houma Louisiana a woman named Patches Wegmann was arrested after two men she plied with cologne claimed to have suffered ill effects from what shed had them breathe in. The first said she accosted him sprayed a cologne sample on a piece of paper and waved it under his nose. Subsequently after he returned to work he passed out his symptoms including dizziness shortness of breath and numbness in his extremities. The second said the colognes fumes left him feeling light-headed and it irritated his skin. Wegmann was charged with second-degree battery and unlawful solicitation but the battery charge has to do with forcing perfume samples upon unwilling parties not because there was anything necessarily noxious in the substance she forced upon them. The incident remains under investigation and authorities say its not clear that anything other than perfume was sprayed on either man. In 2001 a false Internet rumor about seven women having died after sniffing perfume samples sent to them in the mail spread in the wake of the September 11 attacks. This newer rumor was a combination of two older and equally baseless scares: the 1999 perfume robbers tale (which is the topic of the article above) and the 2000 Klingerman Virus warning about blue virus-laden sponges mailed in envelopes marked A gift for you from the Klingerman Foundation which supposedly caused 23 deaths. The 2001 deadly perfume samples rumor brought into play the specter of lurking terrorists using the U.S. mail system to murder the innocent in a women-targeted replay of the anthrax mailings horror. The deadly perfume samples rumor is distinct and indeed far removed from the perfume robbers one yet folks are prone to confuse the two because they both use the word perfume.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 11 May 2017 a slew of disreputable web sites posted an article alleging that a massive number of contraband items were discovered during a customs raid on a container ship belonging to the Clinton Foundation: A ship owned and operated by the Clinton Foundation was raided as it arrived from Africa this morning at the Port of Baltimore. The ship which was supposed to be carrying emergency supplies was actually carrying a cargo that had authorities stunned. BPA Harbormaster Jake Cummings explained to CNN: We received a tip that the Clinton Foundation flagship The Chelsea was carrying illegal contraband into the United States. We honestly didnt know what to expect but what we found was simplysurreal. In the middle of the ships large manifest of containers most of which were empty we found 14 containingpeople. Yes people. They were all Refugees from places like Yemen and Syria and not a single one had any kind of documentation. We interviewed those who spoke English and were told that for $40K anyone can catch a ride to the United States on a ship nobody would ever suspect. The article continues with a list of more illegal items allegedly discovered aboard the Chelsea: Two other containers were also found to contain multiple crates of contraband including illegal fruits that could potentially carry foreign insects and foodborne illnesses weapons without serial numbers on them and no less than 30 pounds of marijuana. Several of the refugees were also found to be in possession of black tar heroin an addictive smokable form of the drug. Without exception all the above claims were fabricated however. No such raid was reported in any legitimate news sources. CNN specifically did not run an interview with the Port of Baltimore harbor master in connection with this or any similar raid. We have found no evidence that the Clinton Foundation owns or operates any kind of cargo ship called the Chelsea. In addition the article originated on a web site known as The Last Line of Defense (about which we have written many times) a satirical venue that cranks out false clickbait stories on a daily basis.

False RATING False ORIGIN [Collected via e-mail March 2002] This is an actual true story and not one of those Internet stories that are passed on and on. This actually happened to one of my dearest nw friends daughter. Her daughter Lauren is 19 yrs. old and a sophomore in college. This happened to her over the Christmas/New Years holiday break. It was the Saturday before New Years and it was about 1 pm in the afternoon. Lauren was driving from here (Winchester Va.) to visit a friend in Warrenton. For those of you who are familiar with the area she was taking Rt. 50 East towards Middleburg and then was going to cut over to I-66 via Rt. 17. Those of you who arent familiar with this area Rt. 50 East is a main road (55 mph and two lanes each side with a big median separating East/West lanes) but is somewhat secluded known for its big horse farms and beautiful country estates. Lauren was actually following behind a state police car shortly after she left Winchester and was going just over 65 mph since she was following behind him. An UNMARKED police car pulled up behind her and put his lights on. My friend and her husband have 4 children (high school and college age) and have always told them never to pull over for an unmarked car on the side of the road but rather wait until they get to a gas station etc. So Lauren actually listened to her parents advice and promptly called #77 on her cell phone to tell the dispatcher that she would not pull over right away. She proceeded to tell the dispatcher that there were 2 police cars one unmarked behind her and one marked in front of her. The dispatcher checked to confirm that there were 2 police cars where she was. There wasnt and she was connected to the policeman in front of her. He told her to keep driving remain calm and that he had back-up already on the way. Ten minutes later 4 police cars surrounded her and the unmarked car behind her. One policeman went to her side and the others surrounded the car behind. They pulled the guy from the car and tackled him to the ground the man was a convicted rapist and wanted for other crimes. Thank God Lauren listened to her parents! She was shaken up but fine. I never knew that bit of advice but especially for a woman alone in a car you should NEVER pull over for an unmarked car in a secluded area. In fact even a marked car after dark should follow you to a populated area. Apparently police have to respect your right to keep going to a safe place. You obviously need to make some signals that you acknowledge them (i.e. put on your hazard lights) or call #77 like Lauren did. I am so thankful that my friend was sitting at our book club meeting telling us this scary story rather than us at her house consoling her had something tragic occurred! Be safe and pass this on to your friends. Awareness is everything! [Collected via e-mail March 2006] A bit of useful advice verified by the Dorset Police. The number does work from a mobile. This actually happened to someones daughter. Lauren was 19 yrs old and in college. This story takes place over the Christmas/New Years holiday break. It was the Saturday before New Year and it was about 1.00pm in the afternoon and Lauren was driving to visit a friend when an UNMARKED police car pulled up behind her and put its lights on. Laurens parents have 4 children (of various ages) and have always told them never to pull over for an unmarked car on the side of the road but rather wait until they get to a service station etc. So Lauren remembered her parents advice and telephoned 112 from her mobile phone. This connected her to the police dispatcher she told the dispatcher that there was an unmarked police car with a flashing blue light on his rooftop behind her and that she would not pull over right away but wait until she was in a service station or busy area. The dispatcher checked to see if there was a police car where she was and there wasnt and he told her to keep driving remain calm and that he had back-up already on the way. Ten minutes later 4 police cars surrounded her and the unmarked car behind her. One policeman went to her side and the others surrounded the car behind. They pulled the guy from the car and tackled him to the ground.. the man was a convicted rapist and wanted for other crimes. I never knew that bit of advice but especially for a woman alone in a car you do not have to pull over for an UNMARKED car. Apparently police have to respect your right to keep going to a safe place. You obviously need to make some signals that you acknowledge them I.e. put on your hazard lights) or call 112 like Lauren did. Too bad the mobile phone companies dont give you this little bit of wonderful information. So now its your turn to let your friends know about 112 (112 is an emergency number on your mobile that takes you straight to the police because 999 does not work if you have no signal). This is good information that I did not know! Please pass on to all your friends especially any females. As far as I am aware 112 uses a system called triangulation so they can also pinpoint exactly where you are phoning from. Whether the accounts reproduced above really represent an actual true story and not one of those Internet stories that are passed on and on is unknown but the main point that most readers have taken from them is undeniably not true: calling #77 or 112 from your cell phone will not connect you to emergency services no matter where you are nor doing so connect you with emergency services even when your cell phone does not have an adequate signal to place outgoing calls. Although in a few states in the U.S. calling #77 on a cell phone will immediately connect you to that states highway patrol that code is far from universal. Some states use #77 but others use *55 *47 *77 or *HP and some dont have any special code at all. Rather than frantically try to figure out which one will work in the area youre in police generally recommend that the best approach is to get around the problem by trying 911 first: Just call 9-1-1 said Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste. Theres no reason to use another number. 9-1-1 is always the best way to reach the police when you need our assistance. The phone number 112 is used as a global emergency phone number in a number of countries primarily in the European Union. In some parts of the United States a call to 112 will roll over to the local 911 system but since 112 is not implemented as a universal emergency number in the U.S. calling 911 directly is the better option. Some police agencies have even issued social media warnings advising the public not to call 112 at all saying that the (idea) that calling 1-1-2 is somehow faster than calling 9-1-1 is utterly false. Regarding the scenario described in the examples at the head of this page police advise motorists to immediately pull over when signaled to do so suggesting those concerned about their safety keep their doors locked and crack their windows to speak with persons presenting themselves as officers of the law. They suggest sidelined drivers who are suspicious of their detainers demands should request to examine the officers photo IDs and ask them where they work then place calls to 911 to verify their identities. While this would certainly be the right way to handle genuine police officers making bona fide traffic stops this method may fail to protect motorists from the ill-intentioned. Real bad guys often carry guns against which locked car doors and cracked windows would avail little by way of protection. The instance of rapists and murderers pretending to be police officers is not of epidemic proportions but enough incidents of this nature have occurred that precautions are warranted. In 1948 in Los Angeles Caryl Chessman successfully robbed couples and sexually assaulted a number of women in California after first fooling them into believing he was a police officer by flashing a red light at their vehicles. (Though often he approached parked cars this way in at least one case he managed to pull over a car that was driving on Pacific Coast Highway.) His method of approach earned him the nickname of The Red Light Bandit. Chessman was executed on a kidnapping charge in 1960 but only after gaining fame for writing three books while in prison (most notably Cell 2455 Death Row) and becoming the focus of the then nascent movement to abolish the death penalty. Since then others have used similar ruses to isolate their victims. More recently in 1997 Arkansas was plagued by its blue light rapist who assaulted three women after first luring them to the side of the road with the help of a police-style blue light mounted on his car. Robert Todd Burmingham was sentenced in 1998 to 80 years in prison for rape kidnapping and aggravated robbery. In 2000 a Tampa woman was sexually assaulted by a man who had put a flashing blue and red light atop his car and motioned her off the road as if he was a police officer. After she admitted she had been drinking he offered to drive her home; she got into his car and he took her to an isolated location where he raped her. That case is still open. Someone who has taken to impersonating a police officer for nefarious purposes is counting upon his intended victims unquestioning cooperation. Because he appears in the guise of a trusted authority figure whose commands must be obeyed he expects automatic reaction to kick in even if it overrides common sense. That could prove a fatal error to make. In 1996 Governor Pataki of New York issued an executive order to prevent unmarked state police cars from stopping motorists for routine traffic violations citing a growing number of cases around the country in which criminals trap their victims by posing as police officers. A March 2002 version of the story changed the girls name from Lauren to Lisa. An October 2003 version moved the action to Australia. Once again 19-year-old Lauren barely escaped disaster but she did so by using the No. 112 feature on her cell phone to summon help. A July 2004 version shifted the story to Canada but in this instance Lauren dialed *677. (The number *677 aka *OPP is the non-emergency cell phone caller line of the Ontario Provincial Police.),,0,0,,

Scam RATING Scam ORIGIN Scammers and malware purveyors are always looking for ways to entice online users into following web links that will lead those victims into the traps set for them and offers of free airline tickets are prime bait in that pursuit of prey. Airline tickets are something nearly everyone uses and have considerable value but their non-material nature and the fact that theyre not tremendously expensive (compared to say a new car) makes it seem plausible to the public that theyre something a business might actually be giving away for free as part of an advertising promotion. The name of Southwest Airlines a major U.S. airline which is also the worlds largest low-cost carrier has frequently been invoked in various online free ticket giveaway scams in recent years. The primary type of free ticket fraud is the sweepstakes scam which intended to lure victims into completing numerous surveys disclosing a good deal of personal information and then agreeing to sign up for costly difficult-to-cancel Reward Offers hidden in the fine print. The scammers spread links via e-mail and Facebook that purport to offer a pair of free air travel tickets on Southwest Airlines to those who follow those links: These web pages (which are not operated or sponsored by Southwest Airlines) typically ask the unwary to click what appear to be Facebook share buttons and post comments to the scammers site (which is really a ruse to dupe users into spreading the scam by sharing it with all of their Facebook friends). Those who follow such instructions are then led into a set of pages prompting them to input a fair amount of personal information (including name age address and phone numbers) complete a lengthy series of surveys and finally sign up (and commit to paying) for at least two Reward Offers (e.g. Netflix subscriptions credit report monitoring services prepaid credit cards): Pursuant to the Terms & Conditions you are required to complete 2 of the Reward Offers from the above. You will need to meet all of the terms and conditions to qualify for the shipment of the reward. For credit card offers you must activate your card by making a purchase transferring a balance or making a cash advance. For loan offers you must close and fund the loan. For home security and satellite tv offers you must have the product installed. You may not cancel your participation in more than a total of 2 Reward Offers within 30 days of any Reward Offer Sign-Up Date as outlined in the Terms & Conditions (the Cancellation Limit). Not only that but the fine print on the free tickets offer states that by accepting its terms the user agrees to receive telemarketing phone calls and text messages from a variety of different companies. Similar phony free ticket lures are used to spread malware. In those versions of the scam those who attempt to reach the URL provided for the purpose of claiming the free tickets are instead victimized by a Facebook lifejacking attack a malicious script that takes over a users Facebook profile without their knowledge and propagates itself to their friends accounts as well. Southwest Airlines has responded to such scams by issuing messages on Twitter that read: Hey folks! There is a scam being passed around on Facebook about a 2 free ticket offer from SWA. Please dont click or share the links! As well Southwest spokesperson Christi McNeill has said of these attempts to defraud that We are aware of the scam for two free tickets being spread across Facebook. This offer is in no way affiliated with Southwest Airlines and we are working with Facebook to get it removed.",,0,0,,

See Example( s ) EXAMPLES Collected via e-mail March 2016 It cannot be true! Bumblebee recalling tuna due to the fact they cooked a worker with the tuna. Cant find anything saying its not true. Can you update me please? False RATING False ORIGIN In March 2016 Bumble Bee Foods announced a pre-emptive recall of some of their canned tuna products due to an issue with the sterilization process at a co-pack facility even though no problems had been reported in association with the products: Bumble Bee Foods LLC announced that it is voluntarily recalling 3 specific UPC codes of canned Chunk Light tuna due to process deviations that occurred in a co-pack facility not owned or operated by Bumble Bee. These deviations were part of the commercial sterilization process and could result in contamination by spoilage organisms or pathogens which could lead to life-threatening illness if consumed. It is important to note that there have been no reports of illness associated with these products to date. No other production codes or products are affected by this recall. There are a total of 31579 cases that are included in the recall which were produced in February 2016 and distributed nationally. The products subject to this recall are marked with a code on the bottom of the can that starts with a T (example: TOA2BSCAFB). The recall is being initiated out of an abundance of caution due to the possible under-processing of the affected products discovered by the co-packer during its routine quality audit. Bumble Bee is working closely with the co-packer and the FDA to expedite the removal of products from commerce. Over three years earlier back in October 2012 a tragic incident at a Bumble Bee Foods processing facility had resulted in the death of a worker named Jos Melena who was killed after being accidentally locked in a large industrial oven: Melena was responsible for loading the 54-inch by 36-foot ovens with 12 rolling metal baskets full of tuna cans. The ovens are used to sterilize aluminum cans and to process the tuna in the cans. At the start of his 4 a.m. shift on Oct. 11 2012 Melena was ordered by his supervisor to load one particular oven. Sometime before 5 a.m. according to the report Melena entered the oven to make a repair or to adjust a chain inside the machine leaving the pallet jack he was using outside the oven. At that time a second employee noticed the unused pallet jacket. Assuming Melena was in the bathroom the second employee took the machine and loaded the oven with the baskets. Around the same time the supervisor questioned why the employee was using the pallet jack and began asking employees if they had seen Melena the [Division of Occupational Safety and Health] report said. The report states an announcement was made on the intercom. Workers also began looking for Melena. They discovered that his vehicle was still in the parking lot. After searching for nearly an hour and a half the boiler operator suggested that they open the last oven that was loaded. The workers waited about 30 minutes for the oven to cool down before they could open it. Melenas body was eventually found at the exit side of the oven. Firefighters pronounced him dead at the scene. This death did not result in any product contamination nor did it have anything to do with the voluntary recall issued by Bumble Bee Foods over three years later. But the fake news sites News 4 KTLA and The Racket Report published misleading articles shortly after the recall announcement that falsely linked the two events reproducing (genuine) three-year-old news reports of Melenas death under the fabricated clickbait headline Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking a Man and Mixing Him with a Batch of Tuna: It is true that two Bumble Bee employees were charged with violating safety regulations in Melenas death back in 2012 but those employees did not mix [his remains] with a batch of tuna nor were their actions in any way related to the March 2016 recall.

False RATING False ORIGIN On 1 March 2017 the web site World News Daily Report (WNDR) reported that Beaumont Texas morgue worker Henri Paul Johnson was inadvertently incinerated by a coworker as he napped on the job: An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers. According to the Beaumont Police Department 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap one a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight. While he was sleeping another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory. Before anyone could notice the mistake he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes. Also depicted in the article was Jenna Davis a coworker who purportedly heard Johnsons death screams: Jenna Davis one of Henri Johnsons coworkers says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated. At first we didnt understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening it was too late. We shut down the heating system but he was already dead. As is the case with all content published by WNDR a fake news site there was no truth to the story. The articles photograph of the supposedly deceased morgue worker Henri Paul Johnson was actually a picture of a DeSoto County constable Christopher Plumlee who was arrested in 2015 for DUI. And the photograph of coworker Jenna Davis was actually a picture of forensic pathologist Dr. Lisa Funte taken from a May 2012 Beaumont Enterprise profile of her. Variations: The story was reposted by a site spoofing ABC News (abcnews-us.com) in December 2017 and March 2018: An employee of a local Huntersville funeral home died this morning after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers. According to the Huntersville medical examiner 48-year old Kenneth Brooks decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight.

False RATING False ORIGIN On 3 December 2014 World News Daily Report published an article titled Smithsonian Admits to Destruction of Thousands of Giant Human Skeletons in Early 1900s. In that article the site reported the Smithsonian Institution colluded with unspecified parties to suppress information proving the existence of giants and the Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that documentation of the discovery be declassified in 2015: A US Supreme Court ruling has forced the Smithsonian institution to release classified papers dating from the early 1900s that proves the organization was involved in a major historical cover up of evidence showing giants human remains in the tens of thousands had been uncovered all across America and were ordered to be destroyed by high level administrators to protect the mainstream chronology of human evolution at the time. The allegations stemming from the American Institution of Alternative Archeology (AIAA) that the Smithsonian Institution had destroyed thousands of giant human remains during the early 1900s was not taken lightly by the Smithsonian who responded by suing the organization for defamation and trying to damage the reputation of the 168-year old institution. During the court case new elements were brought to light as several Smithsonian whistle blowers admitted to the existence of documents that allegedly proved the destruction of tens of thousands of human skeletons reaching between 6 feet and 12 feet in height a reality mainstream archeology can not admit to for different reasons claims AIAA spokesman James Churward. There are a number of factors in the first two paragraphs of the claim that conflict with the standard template for fake news but the article also follows that formula in several ways. On the latter score searches for the American Institution of Alternative Archeology (AIAA) point back either to the article itself or other pages referencing it a strong indicator that organization does not exist. Furthermore the claim regarding the Smithsonian guarding classified documents is unusual: The earliest technically classified documents in the United States go back only as far as World War I (which America entered in 1917) whereas the discovery of giant skeletons is dated vaguely as occurring in the early 1900s. Prior to the first World War the need to classify documents as we would today had not yet come to issue (due to Americas relative then-isolated status) and such a measure would be even less likely to apply to a archaeological discovery. An image World News Daily Report claimed was taken in Ohio in 2011 has existed on the internet since 2008 and prior references identify the location of the picture as Turkey not Ohio. The date initially claimed of the image back then was that it was taken in the 1990s. Another image of giant skulls included with the article dated to a 2008 claim made on the web site of the Coast to Coast radio program. (Misattributed images attached to news articles are almost always red flags the claims made in those articles are shaky.) Yet another image frequently attached to other versions of the claim depict Edouard Beaupre a French-Canadian man afflicted with gigantism who died in 1904. A sideshow celebrity at the time Beaupres existence was hardly a secret and certainly not classified by the Smithsonian Institution. Finally no such Supreme Court decision exists; and if it did it would have been a matter of public record and widely reported in mainstream publications due to its notability. Unlike most fake news stories the giant skeleton claim is an extant long-running rumor that refuses to stay dead rather than a recently invented falsehood. National Geographic has been battling the hoax since at least 2002 and stated in 2007: The National Geographic Society has not discovered ancient giant humans despite rampant reports and pictures. The hoax began with a doctored photo and later found a receptive online audience thanks perhaps to the images unintended religious connotations. A digitally altered photograph created in 2002 shows a reclining giant surrounded by a wooden platform with a shovel-wielding archaeologist thrown in for scale. By 2004 the discovery was being blogged and emailed all over the world Giant Skeleton Unearthed! and its been enjoying a revival in 2007. This version of the tale is certainly fake as it incorporates elements of existing urban legends and hoaxes (obscuring the nature of the source) and World News Daily Reports disclaimer page explicitly states its content is fictional in nature:,,0,0,,

True RATING True ORIGIN In 1972 the alternative newspaper Vermont Freeman published an essay by Bernie Sanders entitled Man and Woman in which the future U.S. senator included a reference to a woman fantasizing about rape. After Sanders gained political prominence as a presidential candidate in 2015 that essay was brought to wider attention in a profile of Sanders published by Mother Jones on 26 May 2015: What Sanders did share with the young radicals and hippies flocking to Vermont was a smoldering idealism forged during his college years as a civil rights activist he coordinated a sit-in against segregated housing and attended the 1963 March on Washington but only a fuzzy sense of how to act on it. Sanders bounced back and forth between Vermont and New York City where he worked at a psychiatric hospital. After his marriage broke up in the late 1960s he moved to an A-frame farmhouse outside the Vermont town of Stannard a tiny hamlet with no paved roads in the buckle of the commune belt. He dabbled in carpentry and tried to get by as a freelance journalist for alternative newspapers and regional publications contributing interviews political screeds and one time a stream-of-consciousness essay on the nature of male-female sexual dynamics: That essay sparked a debate about Sanders and his views on women and conservative outlets such as Young Cons reproduced a portion of the essay in an attempt to illustrate how it was hypocritical for liberals to demonize Republicans for waging a War on Women when Sanders had written about a rape fantasy in a 1972 essay: According to liberals with IQs smaller than their sock size conservative presidential candidates absolutely LOATHE women hate them with a passion even. Those mean old white guys which is a hilarious stereotype given theres latinos blacks and women in the top spots for the GOP want nothing more than to destroy womens health care by defunding the ghoulish Planned Parenthood and encourage rape culture with their antiquated views on gender roles. None of this is actually true of course but when have facts ever got in the way of the liberal agenda? What should really make you scratch your head is how lefties will rake conservatives over the coals for the things mentioned above yet say absolutely nothing about this atrocious Bernie Sanders quote: But of course plenty of publications on both sides of the political spectrum have said a good deal about this atrocious Bernie Sanders quote. NPR for example reported that: The essay by the Vermont senator isnt long only a page. The bit about rape comes at the very beginning as does some not-totally-safe-for-work language: A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees a woman tied up a woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously. The man and woman get dressed up on Sunday and go to Church or maybe to their revolutionary political meeting. Have you ever looked at the Stag Man Hero Tough magazines on the shelf of your local bookstore? Do you know why the newspaper with the articles like Girl 12 raped by 14 men sell so well? To what in us are they appealing? Sanders Sanders then goes on to explain his ideas about gender roles and eventually gets at a sharper point that traditional gender roles help create troubling dynamics in mens and womens sex lives. Many women seem to be walking a tightrope he writes as their qualities of love openness and gentleness were too deeply enmeshed with qualities of dependency subservience and masochism. One way to read the essay is that Sanders was doing (in a supremely ham-handed way) what journalists do every day: draw the reader in with an attention-getting lede then get to the meat of the article in the middle. You can draw divergent conclusions from the article itself. On the one hand hes talking about liberating people from harmful gender norms. On the other with his nameless hypothetical man-and-woman characters he also seems to imply that men fantasize about raping women or that women fantasize about being raped. CNN also covered the controversial essay in a piece that quoted Sanders campaign spokesman describing it as stupid and a dumb attempt at dark satire:",,0,0,,

In August 2014 interest in an in-development product called Undercover Colors swept the social web. According to the students who hatched the idea behind Undercover Colors this nail polish formula works to detect the presence of drugs commonly used to facilitate date rape. Undercover Colors maintains a Facebook page and on it the companys social media team explained why the product was conceived and how it would work: While date rape drugs are often used to facilitate sexual assault very little science exists for their detection. Our goal is to invent technologies that empower women to protect themselves from this heinous and quietly pervasive crime. For our first product we are developing a nail polish that changes color when it comes in contact with date rape drugs such as Rohypnol Xanax and GHB. With our nail polish any woman will be empowered to discreetly ensure her safety by simply stirring her drink with her finger. If her nail polish changes color shell know that something is wrong. The young men behind the Undercover Colors start-up also posted an announcement about their products development status: However Undercover Colors hasnt demonstrated they have anything more tangible than a concept at this point: weve seen no evidence offered that the start-up has produced an effective prototype and some critics have maintained that the concept of such a drug-detecting fingernail polish isnt even a feasible one: While the media cheers we suffer from a severe lack of any actual data on whether these testing kits function. A study of commercially available date-rape drug testing coasters found that they were unreliable changing color for things like different brands of mineral water taking an extremely long time for ketamine and giving a false positive once milk was used. Another study of commercially available card testing kits found that in laboratory conditions testers only correctly detected two out of three drugged samples. An interactive lesson at University at Buffalo found that the GHB test was only an acid test. Anything acidic: wines fruit juices would have caused it to turn positive. Compounding the issue GHB also occurs naturally in wines. While the most frequently used drug in date rapes or DFSAs (drug facilitated sexual assaults) is alcohol multiple studies found the most common substances were cannabis cocaine and MDMA. GHB and Rohypnol were found to be relatively rare. These tests focus their attention on three to four drugs GHB (y-Hydroxybutyric acid) Rohypnol or roofies (flunitrazepam) Xanax (alprazolam) and Special K (ketamine). All of these drugs can weaken your resolve and knock you out at a high enough dosage. Even if these kits worked and were 100% reliable this is a losing battle. Wikipedia lists over 100 benzodiazepines like Xanax and Rohypnol including phenazepam (which can cause you to black out for days) and etizolam. Going beyond benzos adds hundreds more sedatives/hypnotics like Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and Unisom Sleep Tabs (doxylamine) which can be bought over the counter. The designer drug explosions means that theres an entire galaxy of drugs that are just a molecular tweak away. Rapists watch TV and read the Huffington Post. They will know when these things come out and theyll adapt accordingly. So pack up a 40-pound combined gas chromatograph and the mass spectrometer and lets drop in a Raman spectrometer as well to test every drink and then learn to read the results. But this too is futile. While interest in nail polish that detects common drugs used in date rape remains high not everyone is pleased with the idea. Rape prevention advocates have posited that the nail polish drug detection system is a form of tacit victim blaming suggesting the onus should not be on potential victims to prevent rape as feminist writer Jessica Valenti explained in a column for the Guardian: Im appreciative that young men like want to curb sexual assault but anything that puts the onus on women to discreetly keep from being raped misses the point. We should be trying to stop rape not just individually avoid it. Prevention tips or products that focus on what women do or wear arent just ineffective they leave room for victim-blaming when those steps arent taken. Didnt wear your anti-rape underwear? Well what did you expect? For now the nail polish date rape prevention product is still in the development stage and is not available for purchase.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 22 July 2017 a Facebook user claimed (in a since-deleted post) that Walmart had added a phantom charge of $10 to her bill for a item she hadnt purchased which was listed as a JAJKET on her receipt. She posted the claim alongside a photograph of a receipt with the questionable entry on it: I shopped at Walmart in Clinton today. I was charged $10 for absolutely nothing. The item is JAJKET 000000000001K. I called them when I got home and was told that this is a phantom item. It randomly comes up even though it is not scanned. When I asked how long it has been happening I was told almost 10 years. They know about this. It randomly gets added to your ticket and unless you are checking or paying attention then you pay for it without getting anything for it. Going tomorrow to get a refund. This is rediculous! They know it happens but havent told anyone. Told me they cant purge it from their system. When I wondered how many times this has happened to me before they seemed to not care. How many times has it happened to others? I sent an email to corperate office. Hope somebody fixes this! If I took $10 merchandise and said it was a phantom I bet I would be seeing the inside of a jail cell! Watch your receipts! It supposedly comes up same letters and numbers every time. On 25 July 2017 the original poster claimed that Facebook had deleted her post and an alarmist blog concurrently published an item advising shoppers to call the police if a JAJKET code appeared on their Walmart receipts. When we contacted Walmart about the claim a representative confirmed that the issue was under investigation and told us that the chain would provide us with an update when their research concluded. The next day a Walmart representative contacted us to explain that errant charge was a one-time mistake resulting from a bar code (also known as an SKU or stock keeping unit) that had been misentered by hand by a cashier: We immediately began looking into this issue when it was brought to our attention and want to assure customers at our Clinton store that they are only being charged for items they purchase. We isolated the problem our customer experienced to an incorrect product barcode that one of our cashiers entered as she was checking out. The issue was immediately resolved and as a precaution were training the stores associates on what to look for should anything like that happen again and ensuring none of our other stores are affected. We reimbursed the customer for the incorrect charge apologized to her and appreciate that she brought this to our attention. Although the pictured Walmart receipt is real rumors that the retailer has been adding phantom charges to random receipts for years are not. The error was unique to one transaction and we found no other reports of similar issues on social media on Walmarts online pages or anywhere else.",,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN A commonly circulated online item about the dangers of benzene supposedly emitted by automobile components has been widely misunderstood: Do not turn on A/C immediately as soon as you enter the car! Please open the windows after you enter your car and do not turn ON the air-conditioning immediately. According to a research done the car dashboard sofa air freshener emits Benzene a Cancer causing toxin (carcinogen- take note of the heated plastic Smell in your car). In addition to causing cancer it poisons your bones causes anemia and reduces white blood cells. Prolonged exposure will cause Leukemia increasing the risk of cancer. May also cause miscarriage. Acceptable Benzene level indoors is 50 mg per sq. ft.. A car parked indoors with the windows closed will contain 400-800 mg of Benzene. If parked outdoors under the sun at a temperature above 60 degrees F the Benzene level goes up to 2000-4000 mg 40 times the acceptable level and the people inside the car will inevitably inhale an excess amount of the toxins. It is recommended that you open the windows and door to give time for the interior to air out before you enter. Benzene is a toxin that affects your kidney and liver and is very difficult for your body to expel this toxic stuff. Many readers have come away from viewing this piece with the impression that it warns drivers not to use their cars air conditioning because the A/C system itself is producing benzene but what the article actually cautions against is the practice of turning on the air conditioning immediately upon entering an automobile . Motorists should instead it says roll down their windows in order to allow accumulated benzene fumes (allegedly emitted by other components such as dashboards and upholstery) to vent from the car first before re-closing the windows and turning on the A/C. How much truth is there to this warning? Some evidence suggests an association between exposure to benzene and an excess risk of leukemia as noted by the American Cancer Society (ACS): A considerable number of human studies provide evidence linking benzene and cancer. Initially increased risks of leukemia chiefly AML were reported among workers with high levels of benzene exposure in the chemical shoemaking and oil refining industries. More recently studies have focused on workers with relatively lower exposure. The human data are supported by animal studies. There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of benzene in experimental animals. Key animal studies support the finding of an excess risk of leukemia in humans from exposure to benzene by inhalation and ingestion. The details of these studies have been reviewed and found to support the association between benzene and cancer. But do automobiles really produce potentially cancer-causing levels of benzene? No studies have yet documented that claim to be true. A 2001 study of commuter exposure (in both cars and buses) in Korean urban areas found some relationship between automobile use and exposure to benzene but its observations differed from the warning quoted above in some significant areas: The study found that traveling by automobile increased exposure to a number of deleterious compounds including benzene but the primary factor in this regard was the fuel used by the vehicles not internal components such as dashboards. The study found that benzene levels were higher in older cars than newer cars which suggests that the primary factor in automobile benzene levels was not associated with the new car smell emitted by components such as dashboards and upholstery. The study found that exposure levels were significantly higher during the winter months which suggests that automobile air conditioning use is not a major factor in benzene exposure. The Korean study itself did not establish a connection between commuter exposure to benzene and the onset of cancer. A 2007 German study on Toxicity of Parked Motor Vehicle Indoor Air which specifically tested the health effects of emissions from one new and one three-year-old vehicle exposed to parked in sunshine conditions found no apparent health hazard of parked motor vehicle indoor air: Buters and his colleagues first collected molecules from the air inside a new car and a three-year-old vehicle of the same brand placed under 14000 watts of light where temperatures reached up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit. They next exposed these compounds to human mouse and hamster cells grown in lab dishes. These are commonly used to test toxicity. New car smell does not appear to be toxic the scientists found. Air from the new car did cause a slight aggravation of the immune response that could affect people with allergies but the same was not seen with the older vehicle. (The German study also found the total amount of volatile organic compounds in a new car to be one-tenth the level claimed in the e-mail for benzene alone.) The ACS similarly noted of this warning that: We found no published studies that confirm the claims of this e-mail. Benzene levels that exceed recommendations for chronic workplace exposure have been observed in some moving cars but these levels seem unlikely in properly maintained cars. The e-mail did get one thing right though: Upon returning to a closed car on warm days you should optimally open the windows for a minute or so rather than leaving them closed and immediately turning on the air conditioning. The reason has nothing to do with benzene levels however; rather its because when a car is parked in the sun with its windows rolled up that condition can create a greenhouse effect which causes the interior of the vehicle to warm up to a temperature considerably higher than that of the outside air. Opening the windows for a few moments allows for the exchange of hot air from inside the vehicle with cooler air outside speeding up the process of cooling off the car more than air conditioning alone would.,,0,0,,

Mixture RATING Mixture WHATS TRUE A December 2015 Harvard study concluded that diacetyl which is associated with popcorn lung is present in e-cigarettes. WHATS FALSE The Harvard study did not prove a link between e-cigarettes and popcorn lung; it simply stated that the possibility should be explored through additional research. ORIGIN In early August 2016 a number of disreputable clickbait web sites published identical photo galleries alongside claims that a new study had proved e-cigarettes cause0 an incurable condition known as popcorn lung (a common term for bronchiolitis obliterans a disease that results in obstruction of the smallest airways of the lungs due to inflammation and leaves sufferers coughing and feeling short of breath): Most users who shared the story inferred that the man pictured in those photographs was a popcorn lung patient. But a reverse image search revealed that he was in fact the victim of a 2015 e-cigarette explosion not a pulmonary disease: A 22 November 2015 report by Memphis TV station WHBQ documented that the young man seen in these images was a college student who was injured when an improperly assembled e-cigarette exploded in what was described as an avoidable accident: The injuries a college student sustained when an electronic cigarette exploded in his face could have been prevented if the man had been taught to use the e-cigarette properly a smoke shop employee said. Meanwhile the mans family is sharing their story to try to keep the same accident from happening to another person. E-cigarettes are sold in parts. The two main parts are the battery tank and the coil on top that heats to create the vapor. [Vape shop owner Mary Grace] Burns said the combination that made up Caples cigarette was incompatible. Burns said e-cigarette users should buy their products from trusted stores and be weary of online dealers. The confluence of identical articles connecting the unrelated image with popcorn lung led many sources to link to a December 2015 AOL article which in turn linked to a Harvard School of Public Health study published that same month. However the Harvard study did not definitively link e-cigarettes to popcorn lung; rather the research which tested 51 of 7000 available e-liquids concluded: Our findings confirm the presence of diacetyl and other flavoring chemicals in flavored e-cigarettes. Because of the associations between diacetyl and bronchiolitis obliterans and other severe respiratory diseases among workers inhaling heated vapors containing diacetyl urgent action is recommended to further evaluate the extent of this new exposure to diacetyl and related flavoring compounds in e-cigarettes. While the initial findings might have appeared worrisome the presence of diacetyl in e-liquid was not first discovered by Harvard researchers. E-cigarette vendors had widely disclosed its presence in e-liquids as early as 2014 one year prior to the Harvard research. Diacetyls presence in e-juice at variable levels remains a controversial issue among e-cigarette merchants and users but it was hardly a secret before the 2015 study. Concerns about diacetyl and popcorn lung largely stemmed from a paper published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 2002 pertaining to a cluster of eight cases of a respiratory illness resembling bronchiolitis obliterans among workers at a popcorn factory circumstances that led to the colloquialism popcorn lung. But that paper was somewhat inconclusive reporting that: During 1992-2000 factory A employed approximately 560 workers; 425 no longer worked at the factory as of May 2000. Of the eight patients reported four were mixers and four were microwave-packaging workers. No microwave-packaging workers had ever worked as mixers. Discussions with workers and management staff at factory A indicated that an estimated 13 (3%) of the 425 former workers had been mixers 276 (65%) had worked in microwave packaging and 136 (32%) had worked in other areas of the factory. On the basis of this estimated distribution the crude incidence of illness was highest in mixers (four of 13 [31%]) and microwave-packaging workers (four of 276 [1%]); no cases were reported in the estimated 136 workers in other areas of the factory. Assuming exposure to factory work contributed to reported occupational lung disease former workers had 1148-2819 person-years at risk depending on assumptions about whether risk for disease continues after employment ceases. On the basis of the eight cases reported during this period the calculated rate of illness was 28-70 cases per 10000 person-years. Assuming that all eight reported patients represented cases of occupational lung disease this represents a five- to 11-fold excess over the expected number of reported occupational respiratory conditions attributed to toxins. MoDHSS and CDC investigated the worksite for possible exposures to airborne respiratory toxins but found no known substance that could explain the illnesses Industrial hygiene sampling conducted during the November 2000 survey detected approximately 100 VOCs in the plant air. Diacetyl a ketone with butter-flavor characteristics was measured as a marker for exposure to flavoring vapors. The geometric mean air concentration of diacetyl was 18 parts per million parts air (ppm) in the room where the mixing tank was located 1.3 ppm in the microwave-packaging area and 0.02 ppm in other areas of the plant. Its true that the research out of Harvard made waves when it first appeared in December 2015 but immediate criticisms emerged about a key aspect of the study. Rolling Stone was one of the first news outlets to look into the diacetyl scare speaking to Boston University professor and physician Michael Siegel. Siegel addressed a popular objection to the research for eliding prior research of the same nature regarding tobacco cigarettes and diacetyl: While studies like Harvards are critical to fully understanding e-cigs they too often have the opposite effect. Tobacco cigarettes for instance have also long been known to contain diacetyl at levels over 100 times those found in electronic cigarettes yet earlier tobacco studies found that even these levels were not enough to cause popcorn lung in smokers. The Harvard study is a perfect example of something that happens over and over says Michael Siegel a physician and professor at Boston University. It creates a scare by omitting a key piece of information undermining the publics appreciation of the severe hazards of tobacco smoking and leading to perverse public health outcomes. Siegel has spent much of his career fighting tobacco companies: testifying against them in court pushing for smoking bans in bars and restaurants advocating for policies making it illegal to market cigarettes to youth. When e-cigs first started gaining popularity he was skeptical believing them to be little more than a product designed to mask the dangers of smoking. Today however he has become one of the most outspoken supporters of the idea that e-cigs can succeed where the crusade against smoking has come up short. Given that the current e-cig market is dominated by habitual smokers Siegel calls the U.S. governments reluctance to allow them to be pitched as a safer alternative irresponsible. Quantifying the over 100 times tobacco to e-cigarette comparison was difficult given the ranges cited in published research but Siegel expounded upon his comments in an attendant blog post: All conventional cigarettes produce tobacco smoke that contains diacetyl and the levels of diacetyl in cigarettes are a lot higher than those produced by e-cigarettes. In the study Allen et al. found that the average diacetyl content of the products tested was 9.0 micrograms per e-cigarette cartridge. Assuming that a vaper uses one cartridge per day the average daily inhaled dose of diacetyl associated with vaping is therefore 9.0 micrograms. Fujioka and Shibamoto conducted a study to measure the diacetyl exposure from active smoking. They found that the average diacetyl content of the cigarettes tested was 335.9 micrograms per cigarette. Assuming that a smoker consumes one pack per day (20 cigarettes) the average daily inhaled does of diacetyl associated with smoking is therefore 6718 micrograms. Table 1. Average inhaled daily diacetyl dose associated with smoking vs. vaping Vaping: 9 micrograms Smoking: 6718 micrograms Daily exposure to diacetyl from smoking is therefore 750 times higher on average than exposure to diacetyl from vaping. Even if one looks at the maximum detected level of diacetyl in the electronic cigarettes vs. real cigarettes tested the exposure of a smoker is much higher than that of a vaper. The Harvard study held that the e-liquids tested ranged from zero to 239 micrograms in diacetyl content: At least one flavoring chemical was detected in 47 of 51 unique flavors tested. Diacetyl was detected above the laboratory limit of detection 39 of the 51 flavors tested ranging from < limit of qualification (LOQ) to 239 g/e-cigarette. 23-pentanedione and acetoin were detected in 23 and 46 of the 51 flavors tested at concentrations up to 64 and 529 g/e-cigarette respectively. Contrasted with a 2014 study on tobacco consumption diacetyl and popcorn lung it appears that the highest concentration in e-cigarettes is lower than the lowest concentration in tobacco cigarettes at the very least (the comparison was however possibly a somewhat apples-to-oranges one): The yields (g/cigarette) of diacetyl and 23-pentanedione in mainstream (MS) cigarette smoke were evaluated for six tobacco products under three smoking regimens (ISO Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Health Canada Intense) using a standard smoking machine. Mean diacetyl concentrations in MS smoke ranged from 250 to 361 ppm for all tobacco products and smoking regimens and mean cumulative exposures associated with 1 pack-year ranged from 1.1 to 1.9 ppm-years. Mean 23-pentanedione concentrations in MS smoke ranged from 32.2 to 50.1 ppm and mean cumulative exposures associated with 1 pack-year ranged from 0.14 to 0.26 ppm-years A 2005 study on tobacco cigarettes similarly estimated a range of 301 to 433 ppm of diacetyl and overall it was clear tobacco cigarettes contained higher concentrations of diacetyl as demonstrated in both studies. But more telling was the conclusion of the 2014 tobacco research which noted: We found that diacetyl and 23-pentanedione exposures from cigarette smoking far exceed occupational exposures for most food/flavoring workers who smoke. This suggests that previous claims of a significant exposure-response relationship between diacetyl inhalation and respiratory disease in food/flavoring workers were confounded because none of the investigations considered or quantified the non-occupational diacetyl exposure from cigarette smoke yet all of the cohorts evaluated had considerable smoking histories. Further because smoking has not been shown to be a risk factor for bronchiolitis obliterans our findings are inconsistent with claims that diacetyl and/or 23-pentanedione exposure are risk factors for this disease. Moreover a separate study about occupational popcorn lung published in 2012 paradoxically held that non-smokers may be at higher risk for popcorn lung than smokers are: The 2015 research from Harvard omitted comparison to a far larger and more established control group of smokers when asserting concerns about diacetyl popcorn lung and e-cigarettes. Prior research into tobacco cigarettes (which contain measurably higher levels of diacetyl and are more commonly used than e-cigarettes) determined that smoking is not a risk factor for popcorn lung so the lower concentrations of diacetyl in e-cigarette juices are not likely a risk factor in popcorn lung.",,0,0,,

In the city of Tokyo (Japan) the first restaurant in the world that legally offers Humana meat was inaugurated. A scary restaurant nicknamed The Resoto ototo no shoku ryohin which means in English Edible Brother opened its doors to the Japanese public and from all over the world where it offers its customers a varied menu where prices vary from 100 up to 1000 euros that is to say the dish with human flesh more expensive would be 1193 US dollars. International news sources have reported that a tourist from the country of Argentina was the first man to eat human flesh in the Edible Brother. This diner I think the following: It seems like eating pork in this restaurant they cook the meat with spices so the taste goes unnoticed. In Japan since 2014 a law was approved that allows the consumption of human flesh obviously conserving conditions such as the sanitary level of this and the origin. However there is no doubt that at least 99% of the world population would not agree with these grotesque acts so to speak. And the question we all ask ourselves how do they get the meat? The people before dying decide to sell their bodies to the peculiar restaurant approximately for about 30 thousand euros or 35799 dollars this is the balance that those interested can leave their families logically they are the only ones who can claim the money. Only people who die young can sign the contract in which they are subject to a special diet where the meat is suitable for consumption. And would you be willing to sell your body to be consumed after your death? Source,"CLAIM Georgia recently became the first U.S. state to ""ban Muslim culture."" False RATING False WHATS TRUE Back in November 2016 a Georgia state representative filed a bill that would have made it a misdemeanor to wear hoods or masks in public with no religious exemption. WHATS FALSE The bill was withdrawn two days after it was filed and the state has taken no other action to ""ban Muslim culture."" ORIGIN In March 2017 the web site usanewspost.us published an article misleadingly headlined GEORGIA BECOMES FIRST STATE TO BAN MUSLIM CULTURE IN HISTORIC MOVE TO RESTORE WESTERN VALUES!!! The headline was both factually inaccurate solely referencing an outdated four-month old news item. Back on 15 November 2016 Georgia lawmaker Jason Spencer introduced a short-lived piece of legislation that would outlaw wearing hoods or head coverings in public a bill critics said was intended to target Muslim women who wear head coverings (known as hijabs) or full-face coverings (called niqabs). The text of House Bill 3 would have made the wearing of head coverings in public and while operating a vehicle a misdemeanor crime: A person is guilty of a misdemeanor when he or she wears a mask hood or device by which any portion of the face is so hidden concealed or covered as to conceal the identity of the wearer and is upon any public way or public property or upon the private property of another without the written permission of the owner or occupier of the property to do so. For purposes of this subsection the phrase upon any public way or property includes but is not limited to operating a motor vehicle upon any public street road or highway. We were unable immediately reach Spencer but he told WSB-TV Atlanta reporter Aaron Diamant that the law was meant to target Muslims: This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us. But Spencer pulled the bill the shortly after he filed it outlining his reasons for doing so in a statement that said: While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group I am mindful of the perception that it has created. My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety. However further consideration dictates that other solutions will need to be considered. In conclusion anti-masking statutes have been upheld as constitutional (State v Miller 1990) and HB 3 would withstand legal scrutiny but not political scrutiny. The case Spencer cited State v. Miller upheld the Anti-Mask Act. The law was meant to prevent members of the Ku Klux Klan from intimidating or committing crimes against minority groups with impunity by making it illegal for them to wear Klan garb and terrorize people.",,0,0,,

See Example( s ) EXAMPLES Collected via e-mail October 2015 I received this email on 10/14/15. Some of the claims seem a little outlandish. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- A Female Physician in Munich Germany sends a message to the world ... Yesterday at the hospital we had a meeting about how the situation here and at the other Munich hospitals is unsustainable. Clinics cannot handle emergencies so they are starting to send everything to the hospitals. Many Muslims are refusing treatment by female staff and we women are refusing to go among those animals especially from Africa. Relations between the staff and migrants are going from bad to worse. Since last weekend migrants going to the hospitals must be accompanied by police with K-9 units. Many migrants have AIDS syphilis open TB and many exotic diseases that we in Europe do not know how to treat them. If they receive a prescription in the pharmacy they learn they have to pay cash. This leads to unbelievable outbursts especially when it is about drugs for the children. They abandon the children with pharmacy staff with the words: So cure them here yourselves! So the police are not just guarding the clinics and hospitals but also large pharmacies. Truly we said openly: Where are all those who had welcomed in front of TV cameras with signs at train stations?! Yes for now the border has been closed but a million of them are already here and we will definitely not be able to get rid of them. Until now the number of unemployed in Germany was 2.2 million. Now it will be at least 3.5 million. Most of these people are completely unemployable. A bare minimum of them have any education. What is more their women usually do not work at all. I estimate that one in ten is pregnant. Hundreds of thousands of them have brought along infants and little kids under six many emaciated and neglected. If this continues and German re-opens its borders Im going home to the Czech Republic. Nobody can keep me here in this situation not even double the salary than at home. I went to Germany not to Africa or the Middle East. Even the professor who heads our department told us how sad it makes him to see the cleaning woman who for 800 Euros cleans every day for years and then meets young men in the hallways who just wait with their hand outstretched want everything for free and when they dont get it they throw a fit. I really dont need this! But Im afraid that if I return that at some point it will be the same in the Czech Republic. If the Germans with their nature cannot handle this there in Czechia it would be total chaos. Nobody who has not come in contact with them has no idea what kind of animals they are especially the ones from Africa and how Muslims act superior to our staff regarding their religious accommodation. For now the local hospital staff has not come down with the diseases they brought here but with so many hundreds of patients every day this is just a question of time. In a hospital near the Rhine migrants attacked the staff with knives after they had handed over an 8-month-old on the brink of death which they had dragged across half of Europe for three months. The child died in two days despite having received top care at one of the best pediatric clinics in Germany. The physician had to undergo surgery and two nurses are laid up in the ICU. Nobody has been punished. The local press is forbidden to write about it so we know about it through email. What would have happened to a German if he had stabbed a doctor and nurses with a knife? Or if he had flung his own syphilis-infected urine into a nurses face and so threatened her with infection? At a minimum hed go straight to jail and later to court. With these people so far nothing has happened. And so I ask where are all those greeters and receivers from the train stations? Sitting pretty at home enjoying their non-profits and looking forward to more trains and their next batch of cash from acting like greeters at the stations. If it were up to me I would round up all these greeters and bring them here first to our hospitals emergency ward as attendants. Then into one building with the migrants so they can look after them there themselves without armed police without police dogs who today are in every hospital here in Bavaria and without medical help. Unproven RATING Unproven ORIGIN On 8 October 2015 the web site The Right Scoop published the above-reproduced missive as an article headlined MUST WATCH: Whistleblower Doctor Explains HORRIFIC Reality Dealing with Muslim Invaders in Germany not long afterwards verbatim versions of the same commentary began circulating in an e-mail frequently titled A Female Physician in Munich Germany Sends a Warning Message to The World The Right Scoop claimed credit for transcribing the letter from the video embedded above; but whether that translation is an accurate one is unclear. A longer version of the same clip was uploaded to YouTube on 6 October 2015 and both clips began with what appeared to be repetition of an older rumor involving refugees and Oktoberfest. The source of the missive was apparently an on-air reading by a Czech newscaster who recited what was said to be a letter from a Czech doctor treating immigrants in a German hospital. Its assertions were a blend of difficult-to-verify first-person claims and opinion (mixed with a measure of undiluted misinformation) its purported author was an unnamed female physician and a handful of its talking points were claims about incidents at an unidentified Munich hospital in the weeks following an influx of Middle Eastern refugees to Germany in September 2015. (The piece was almost certainly veiled criticism of German citizens who had welcomed asylum-seekers with open arms a few weeks prior to its circulation.) Like earlier polemics written from the perspective of an authority figure the occupation of the writer served to bolster the e-mails claims and lend credibility to them its difficult to imagine the items gaining such traction had it been the perspective of a barista or dog walker. The claims contained in the letter were not dated (making it easier for them to circulate in perpetuity) so verifying even the scant collection of non-opinion statements offered in the e-mail is difficult. In its first portion the writer claimed that Muslims had refused to be treated by female doctors (and that and we women are refusing to go among those animals especially from Africa): Many migrants have AIDS syphilis open TB and many exotic diseases that we in Europe do not know how to treat them. If they receive a prescription in the pharmacy they learn they have to pay cash. This leads to unbelievable outbursts especially when it is about drugs for the children. They abandon the children with pharmacy staff with the words: So cure them here yourselves! So the police are not just guarding the clinics and hospitals but also large pharmacies. AIDS syphilis and tuberculosis are hardly diseases modern doctors would consider exotic and it beggars belief that anyone (particularly a physician) would claim medical professionals dont know how to treat them. Theres some truth to the assertion Muslim men might eschew care from female doctors as a 2010 New York Times article explained: People who are non-mahram adults of the opposite sex are prohibited from being alone together in a closed place where sexual intercourse could occur or where even such an accusation could be made [Dr. Aasim I.] Padela said. A prophetic tradition states that when a non-mahram woman and man are alone together Satan is the third among them Dr. Padela noted so the laws prohibit not only adultery but proximity to adultery. As a result Muslim men too may be reluctant to be cared for by female physicians. However that same piece also covered the larger issue of patient comfort and bedside manner; and open contempt for patients (as expressed by the putative author of the letter from a Munich hospital) is unusual in medical settings where most doctors and nurses are accustomed to providing care to all whether or not those interactions are pleasant. The Munich physicians letter also stated: Until now the number of unemployed in Germany was 2.2 million. Now it will be at least 3.5 million. Most of these people are completely unemployable. A bare minimum of them have any education. What is more their women usually do not work at all. I estimate that one in ten is pregnant. Hundreds of thousands of them have brought along infants and little kids under six many emaciated and neglected. If this continues and German re-opens its borders Im going home to the Czech Republic. Nobody can keep me here in this situation not even double the salary than at home. I went to Germany not to Africa or the Middle East. As of July 2015 there were an estimated 2.8 million people registered as unemployed in Germany and the author didnt cite any source for predictions that number would rise to 3.5 million based on an influx of asylum seekers. The one in 10 is pregnant figure is an admitted estimation by the e-mails writer for which we could find no corroborating evidence (and it further stands to reason that pregnant refugees would seek medical care with higher frequency than women in general for obvious reasons). However it should be noted that that overall claim deviated significantly from other popular refugee rumors which consistently described those seeking asylum as predominantly men of fighting age. The missive went on to state: For now the local hospital staff has not come down with the diseases they brought here but with so many hundreds of patients every day this is just a question of time. In a hospital near the Rhine migrants attacked the staff with knives after they had handed over an 8-month-old on the brink of death which they had dragged across half of Europe for three months. The child died in two days despite having received top care at one of the best pediatric clinics in Germany. The physician had to undergo surgery and two nurses are laid up in the ICU. Nobody has been punished. The notion that spikes in immigration lead to outbreaks of disease is a common theme among rumors that circulate during crises that drive large numbers of people out of a given area. Media speculation about such public health concerns inevitably follows; but (as the author conceded) those predictions have not come to pass in connection with Syrian refugees. We were unable to find any news reports that any hospital workers near the Rhine had been attacked by refugees at any point in 2015 in the manner described by the author. The e-mail continued by stating: The local press is forbidden to write about it so we know about it through email. What would have happened to a German if he had stabbed a doctor and nurses with a knife? Or if he had flung his own syphilis-infected urine into a nurses face and so threatened her with infection? At a minimum hed go straight to jail and later to court. With these people so far nothing has happened. Precisely what it the local press [was] forbidden to report was left to the readers preconceptions (presumably the alleged attacks on medical personnel by immigrants); but news coverage about the ongoing refugee crisis wasnt subject to any blackout or other restriction (as attested to by comprehensive global news coverage of the situation). The author seemed to hint that similar e-mails were the source for the claims accounts that proliferate on social media but dont appear in the news. However the reason for the absence of such accounts from the news media is far more likely their dubious credibility than any sort of censorship of reporting which itself creates a self-propelling narrative of widespread suppression. The author of this missive concluded: And so I ask where are all those greeters and receivers from the train stations? Sitting pretty at home enjoying their non-profits and looking forward to more trains and their next batch of cash from acting like greeters at the stations. The writer seems to suggest as a footnote that the crowds of Germans who warmly received refugees weeks earlier were paid by unnamed parties insinuating that the sole motivation for their display of welcome was financial. As it stands no one has stepped forward to claim authorship of the popular polemic; and a number of its assertions are shaky unsupported or simply opinion-based (such as the repeated description of African people as animals). Were there any truth to its claims theres no demonstrable reason why that information would be subject to a blackout of any description; and even the conspiracy-level censorship alleged by the writing would be unlikely to stop such reports from reaching the world at large through social media and blogs. Variations: The name of Dr. Barbara Sziraki has since become attached to this message but she appears to be a Los Angeles psychologist who simply forwarded the letter via e-mail and not a Czech physician working in Germany.",,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN Photographs showing bananas with unusual red discolorations inside have been passed around online with varying degrees of paranoia for several years: I bought a bundle of bananas from the Walmart in Aberdeen tonight and opened it to give to my 2 yr old daughter. This is what I found on the inside! I opened the rest of the bundle and they appeared to be normal bananas. Im not saying its blood but what else would it be?! One banana out of the whole bundle was like this a little weird! Check your produce before eating it. You never know what someone put in there. The claims associated with the photographs have evolved from speculation about the discoloration of the bananas (as seen above) to assertions that the discoloration was due to someones purposefully injecting bananas with infected blood in order to spread HIV: This form of reddish discoloration in bananas has nothing to do with blood of any sort however: Its a hallmark of a fungal or bacterial diseases that affect bananas grown in some areas and can cause their centers to turn dark red. Although the discoloration may make bananas seem visually unappealing to consumers the plant diseases that cause it pose no real health risk to humans who eat such bananas: There are a variety of plant diseases that can cause the inside of bananas to take on a red discolouration. This discolouration has led to false claims of bananas containing blood. Nigrospora is a fungal disease that causes the centre of the banana to turn dark red. Nigrospora can infect the fruit in tropical climates where bananas are grown. Mokillo moko and blood disease bacterium are bacterial diseases that can also cause red discoloration in bananas. While unappealing to eat these diseases affecting bananas are not a threat to human health however when in doubt throw it out or compost them. As we noted in another article about a rumor concerning supposed blood-tainted oranges it is nearly impossible for the HIV virus to be transmitted via foodstuffs:,,0,0,,

Unproven RATING Unproven ORIGIN Staunch supporters of Donald Trump spent the first half of October 2016 attempting to deflect criticism of the Republican presidential nominee after a 2005 video surfaced capturing him making lewd and offensive comments about women. One of the strategies they emmployed was to downplay Trumps comments by asserting that most men engaged in such locker room talk and accusing Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama of having said worse things. For example a misleading WikiLeaks e-mail was circulated with the claim that it documented Hillary Clintons using the term sand niggers to refer to Mulisms and an out-of-context video of President Obama using the word pussy was passed around on social media. On 12 October 2016 the web site Grabien News took this defense to another level claiming that a 2008 video showed President Obama behaving just as salaciously as Trump had done in the 2005 video: As Donald Trump weathers a storm of controversy over randy comments he made to TV celebrity reporter Billy Bush in 2005 new video to emerge from the 2008 presidential campaign shows now-President Obama appearing to behave just as salaciously. Aboard a campaign flight then-Senator Obama is talking on a cellphone as he arises from his seat; nearby a female reporter catches a glance of something that makes her uncomfortable sending her skirmishing to the back of the plane. Obama rather than downplay the awkward display instead plays it up positioning himself so the gathered reporters have little choice but to take in his chauvinistic performance. Meanwhile a female voice can be heard ordering everyone to sit down ostensibly so they can get a better look. The gathered female reporters laugh at the scene further encouraging Obamas bawdy behavior. The video originally shot by CNN cameras emerged Tuesday on Twitter where it spread quickly. While Grabien News interpretation of this video was amusing they provided no actual proof for anything they claimed. The video is too grainy to tell if it actually captured Barack Obama sporting an erection and theres no evidence in the video that the female reporter was uncomfortable that Obama lifted his leg as a chauvinistic display or that people were told to sit down so they could get a better look. Grabien News saw what they wanted to see in the video an erection and then invented the emotions and subsequent actions of passengers on the plane in order to fit their narrative. Other viewers may see nothing out of the ordinary in Obamas pants a small object in his pocket or an embarrassing bunch-up of cloth. The video is open to some interpretation it is certainly not hard evidence that Barack Obama flaunted his erection to female supporters. According to Getty Images the above-displayed video was taken on 7 May 2008 as Obama boarded his campaign plane at Midway Airport. The captions included with those photographs taken by Mark Wilson simply stated that Obama was talking on his phone as the plane boarded: Embed from Getty Images Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) talks on his cell phone as he boards his campaign plane at Midway Airport en-route to Washington DC May 7 2008 in Chicago Illinois. Senator Obama won the North Carolina Primary beating Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and lost Indiana primary to Clinton by a small margin. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) It should also be noted that this video has been circulating since at least 2008 when it was used to smear then-Senator Obama during his first presidential campaign. The web site Obambi was one of the first to share the video along with the baseless claim that it depicted Obama with an erection. Ironically back then Obambi posted the video along with an exhortation to vote for Hillary Clinton: Regards Obamas erection. Ive seen middle school boys handle this with more decorum. This type of behavior is juvenile and just one more example of Obamas exhibiting poor judgement. Please we have an admittedly flawed but exceedingly superior woman whom we could run against McCain. I love Senator McCain I really do. Im an Arizonan. But change is what we need. The only woman who could deliver that for us right now is Senator Hillary Clinton. A classy lady. America will never opt for a classless Obama. We examined the video and tried to find screenshots where Obamas erection was most visible but we came up empty-handed. While some viewers may argue that a bulge is visible in Obamas pants theres no definitive evidence that the future president had an erection and certainly nothing to suggest that he flaunted his manhood in front of female reporters.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 6 December 2017 Breitbart added to their highly shareable series of articles claiming falsely to have found proof that climatologists manipulate data to exaggerate the threat of global warming. Taking a break from their usual misreading of global temperature records the outlet dipped its toes this time into sea level records. The claim like many other pushed by Breitbart author James Delingpole is based on a research paper first highlighted by a post on a blog with a history of misrepresenting or manipulating data. The study itself was written by an ex-Fiat engineer publishing under an assumed name with no formal training in sea level data who is infamous within the climate community for pushing a high volume of questionable studies in journals desperate for submissions. The study which does not appear to have been copyedited asserts that scientists have been arbitrarily adjusting historical tide gauge data to inflate estimates of sea level rise. As evidence the study focuses on the routine corrections scientists applied to a single record in Aden Yemen. How Do Scientists Know Sea Levels are Rising? Scientists around the world have arrived at the consensus that sea levels have risen by about 1.7 millimeters on average per year since the 1900s and that the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. Researchers arrived at this conclusion mostly by using tide gauge records some of which go back as far as the 1700s. These records created by simple instruments in harbors around the world that measure the height of sea level relative to a fixed point on land provide scientists with the longest record of changing sea level based on human-made measurements. Marta Marcos a sea-level researcher at the University of the Balearic Islands in Spain told us by email that raw data from tide gauges comes with a number of natural challenges: Land sometimes rises or sinks for example and the oceans currents and global mass distribution shift over time. Like many historical records the data are subject to human or instrument errors and differ in quality geographic coverage and temporal range. Accounting for all these factors to get a global picture is the main focus of most contemporary sea-level research Macros said. Philip Woodworth a former director of the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) told us that one of the main challenges for scientists working with tide gauge records is inconsistencies in documentation like if a station moves to a new location or a harbor changes its measurement methods. The PSMSL which is part of Britains Natural Environment Research Council is one of the primary organizations that works to compile sea level data from tide gauge records. Yet all the methods scientist use to adjust the data generally agree on the same thing according to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment: that it is very likely that the sea level has been rising by about 1.7 mm per year globally from 1900-2010 a rate that is now accelerating. The paper Breitbart promotes attempts to cast doubt on both PSMSL and their large dataset which includes over 2000 stations around the world. As proof it uses the adjustments made to a single one of these records in Yemen. Are Scientists Fabricating Data? In a paper (Is the Sea Level Stable at Aden Yemen?) published in the second issue of a brand new journal Earth Systems and Environment Albert Parker (an ex-Fiat engineer with no university affiliation) and Cliff Ollier (a retired geologist from the University of Western Australia and a member of an Australian climate skeptic organization) claim without evidence that the corrections applied to one of the oldest tide gauge records in the Indian Ocean a record from Aden Yemen were arbitrary and manufactured to exaggerate sea level rise. The authors main proof that this is the case? Their description of the raw data at Aden Yemen (which doesnt show dramatic rise in sea level) and that of the corrected data (which does show a rise in sea level) in a tone suggesting: we caught you! They then conclude that the adjustments to the Aden record were arbitrarily composed to produce a high trend high acceleration record. (The data they describe are freely available on the PSMSL web site). To prove their point they created their own arbitrary correction to the raw data showing that it should actually show virtually no sea level rise. However they provide no basis for their adjustments to the raw data they merely compare them to records from two other stations without ever proving that these comparisons have merit. John Church a sea level expert at Australias University of New South Wales and the lead author on the IPCCs sea level rise chapter described Parker and Olliers work this way: Parker and Ollier dismiss this work by PSMSL saying it is incorrect and arbitrary. However they provide absolutely no information to support their allegations. Instead they make up their own adjustments to the sea level record so that the trend over the series is minimal. Parker and Ollier also never address the scientific rationale documented by scientists working with the Aden dataset. Oftentimes these adjustments were based on interpretations of documentation from the Aden port and are checked against nearby records theoretically likely to present similar tide histories. They have been further supported by modern instrumentation installed at Aden in the mid 2000s. Woodworth told us the most recent adjustments to the Aden record were based on his work and came from a reassessment of the Aden datas documentation: It is not out of the question that if new documentation becomes available or if there is new interpretation of the existing documentation that sections of the record could be altered again. There is nothing sinister about that one always tries to provide records that are as reliable as possible and there is no conspiracy to make them look as if sea level is rising. Parker and Ollier could perhaps direct blame toward the PSMSL for not digitizing literally every bit of untranslated raw Aden tide gauge data documentation. However Parker and Ollier are categorically wrong when they suggest that scientists made these adjustments without rationale as detailed in a formal response from PSMSL. Further the two authors provide no credible evidence that their version of corrected data is superior to the PSMSLs. Who Is Albert Parker and Why is Breitbart Quoting Him? Numerous scientists have alleged that Albert Parker is actually a former Fiat engineer named Alberto Boretti. Boretti who listed an engineering Ph.D. on an archived faculty page held a professorship at Australias now-defunct University of Ballarat and he appears to have started using the name Parker professionally sometime around 2012 when he took on a teaching role at Australias RMIT University. In a press release about his then-affiliation with their Green Engines Research Facility RMIT described him as an engine technology expert. According to Woodworth (who also echoed claims that Parker and Boretti are the same person) Parker is a prolific author of unreadable papers which he publishes in journals desperate for submissions. This paper certainly fits that profile as it was published in the second issue of Earth Systems and Environment. Not overloaded with submissions by any stretch the journal accepted a second Parker and Ollier study in that same issue. Under the name Albert Parker he served as a reviewer for the sea level chapter of the IPCCs most recent climate assessment report. His primary contribution as a reviewer was to suggest that eight Alberto Boretti papers and four Albert Parker papers should have been mentioned. The final draft of the IPCC chapter devotes a paragraph to these works largely dismissing them as lacking merit. Church who was the lead author of that chapter told us: The hurdle for being an IPCC reviewer is set very low and yes [Parker] was a reviewer. We had to respond to his comments which included that we had not previously referred to his long list of papers. You can look up his comments and our responses on the IPCC web site everything is [] open for inspection. Scientists have publicly criticized the scientific conclusions of his papers for being nonsensical and inaccurate. Responding to a 2013 Parker paper oceanographer John Hunter described his analysis as collection of the authors personal views masquerading as a comment. We reached out to Parker to confirm his academic background. Outside of telling us he had a Ph.D. and masters in engineering Parker/Boretti ignored our multiple requests for clarification about where he got his degrees and what professorships he has held. His co-author Ollier also refused to tell us anything about Parkers background outside of his being an engineer. How then could so many red flags have been ignored by Breitbarts James Delingpole? Because as he explained in an October 2017 open letter he does not read the papers he reports on and instead blindly trusts the analysis of a skeptic blog called the No Tricks Zone. That blog searches for papers that sound like they challenge the consensus on global warming (whether or not they actually do). Lifes too short to spend any more time than he has to on his climate stories he wrote.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 28 February 2017 President Donald Trump appeared before a joint session of Congress to deliver a speech similar to a State of the Union address during the latter part of which he took time to introduce Carryn Owens the widow of U.S. Navy Special Operator Senior Chief William Ryan Owens. Ryan Owens died in a raid in Yemen the first American combatant to die during the presidency of Donald Trump and the introduction of his widow was met with a standing ovation by those present in the House chamber: Among the reactions to President Trumps speech and that particular portion of it was a false and manufactured controversy holding that prominent Democrats Debbie Wasserman Schultz Keith Ellison Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi refused to stand to honor Mrs. Owens. For example a Blaze article headlined Meet the Democrats who refused to stand and applaud the widow of a fallen Navy SEAL asserted that: [C]ameras captured top Democrat Reps. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) staying firmly seated seemingly emotionless and refusing to clap for Owens. A Daily Wire item headlined AWFUL: Top Democrats Refuse to Stand Clap for Navy SEAL Widow Honored by Trump proclaimed that: As [Owens] widow wept and mouthed to heaven I love you baby Trump led a round of applause that lasted two minutes. And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) apparently sat there and didnt cheer as the incredible moment progressed along with Senator Bernie Sanders and others see this video at approximately three minutes in as the cameras pan the crowd. Look at the right hand side of this screenshot. A 100PercentFedUp piece headlined HORRIBLE! TOP DEMOCRATS Refuse to Stand for Gold Star Widow maintained that: President Trump honored the widow of fallen Navy SEAL Ryan Owens with a beautiful acknowledgment. Carryn Owens was given a standing ovation we wont soon forget. The big problem with this amazing moment is that half of the room sat in defiance of President Trump BUT this wasnt about the president! The Democrats are so blinded by their hatred for Trump that they sat emotionless refusing to honor the fallen. Wow! A low moment for these haters just gave Trump four more years But examination of multiple video and photographic sources (including the full video of President Trumps speech embedded below) documents that the claim DEMOCRATS Refuse to Stand for Gold Star Widow was undeniably false. The sequence of events began when President Trump introduced Mrs. Owens by saying We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens the widow of U.S. Navy special operator Senior Chief William Ryan Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior and a hero battling against terrorism and securing our nation. At that point members from both sides of the aisle stood and applauded in acknowledgment of a teary-eyed Carryn Owens who remained seated (and did not herself clap) in acknowledgment that the ovation was directed at her: As we documented in a video we compiled (still frames from which are reproduced below) the visual evidence proves that in fact all four of the Democrats named did indeed stand and honor Mrs. Owens when she was introduced. Rep. Nancy Pelosi was standing and applauding the introduction of Mrs. Owens: Senator Bernie Sanders was likewise standing and clapping: And Reps. Wasserman Schultz and Ellison could also be seen clearly standing at that point (but camera angle didnt capture their hands to document whether they were applauding): Sites such as the Daily Wire misleadingly tried to make the false case that Democrats had remained seated and refused to stand or applaud Mrs. Owens introduction by presenting images that were deceptively taken out of context from other portions of the speech. For example the Daily Wire articles header image seemingly shows Reps. Wasserman Schultz and Ellison stubbornly remaining seated and unmoved during the introduction of the Gold Star widow but that image actually depicted a portion of the speech that had taken place more than half an hour before the tribute to Mrs. Owens while President Trump was speaking about inner cities: A still image capturing a wider view of the chamber was touted as supposedly showing Democrats (including Rep. Nancy Pelosi) remaining seated while only Republicans cheered Mrs. Owens but it was taken from much later in the sequence and depicted members of the audience who had begun sitting down again (not members who had never stood in the first place): As usual once the debunkings began those who promulgated the original false claim began shifting the goalposts moving off the demonstrably untrue assertion about four Democrats who supposedly refused to stand for a Gold Star widow and instead focusing on a different portion of the Presidents speech that was distinctly separate from the introduction of Mrs. Owens. As documented above after President Trump said We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens everyone present (including Debbie Wasserman Schultz Keith Ellison Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi) all rose to give her a standing ovation. Afterwards the entire audience sat down again as President Trump continued his speech. After Trump resumed talking about what he termed the highly successful raid [in Yemen] that generated large amounts of vital intelligence in which Ryan Owens was killed the audience rose again and delivered a second round of applause. But that subsequent ovation was not for Mrs. Owens herself who had already previously been introduced who had not been mentioned again and who this time also stood and joined in the applause (acknowledging that it was not directed at her): Promulgators of the Top Democrats Refuse to Stand Clap for Navy SEAL Widow headlines seized on this second separate round of applause to support their inaccurate assertions but those assertions were false on two counts: this second ovation was not directed at Mrs. Owens and the visual evidence again shows that some of those accused of not standing (e.g. Bernie Sanders) were clearly on their feet and applauding even during this subsequent event: The visual evidence shows Reps. Wasserman Schultz and Ellison seated during portions of that second round of applause but because cameras were largely focused on Mrs. Owens and other audience members at that time its difficult to definitively determine whether those two stood up and then sat down earlier than others did or did not rise at all a second time. But even if the latter were the case the claim that Debbie Wasserman Schultz Keith Ellison Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi refused to stand for Navy SEAL Widow is still false; the most that could be accurately asserted is that two of those four may not have stood during a second subsequent round of applause that was not directed at Mrs. Owens. A more accurate description of events than the ones spread via outrage-provoking blog posts would have stated that Democrats stood for Gold Star widow but maybe some of them didnt stand and applaud as long or as much as some Republicans did afterwards but of course such honesty wouldnt generate nearly as many click-throughs as false headlines such as HORRIBLE!

False RATING False ORIGIN On 20 January 2018 the Americas Last Line of Defense web site published an article positing that New York Senator Chuck Schumer had accepted a campaign donation of half a million dollars from pro-immigration groups just prior to a crucial Congressional vote: Democrat Senator Charles Schumer was willing to shut down the government and hurt millions of people while causing billions in economic damage over his desire to remove penalties for illegal aliens and open the borders but have you wondered why?

False RATING False ORIGIN On 19 June 2017 the YourNewsWire web site published the implausible claim that a former MI5 agent named John Hopkins had confessed to assassinating Princess Diana in 1997: An 80-year-old retired MI5 agent John Hopkins has made a series of astonishing confessions since he was released from hospital in London on Wednesday and told he has weeks to live. Hopkins claims to have been involved in 23 assassinations for the British intelligence agency between 1973 and 1999 including Princess Diana. The 80-year-old British man claims he was involved with MI5 assassinations between June 1973 and December 1999 during a period he says the MI5 operated with less external oversight. Hopkins says he was part of a cell of seven operatives who were trusted to carry out political assassinations across the UK. Most victims were politicians activists journalists and union leaders. Mr. Hopkins says Princess Diana is unique among his victims as she is the only female he ever assassinated as well as the only Royal. She is also the only victim that the Royal Family themselves ordered to be taken out He claims to feel ambivalent about Princess Dianas death. On the one hand Diana was a beautiful kind-hearted woman who did not deserve to have her life cut short. But according to Mr. Hopkins she was also placing the British Crown at risk: There was no truth to the story which originated with YourNewsWire a fake news site. As is often the case with fake news the article lacked critical details such as when and where the confession occurred or how the purported assassination took place and no other credible news outlet (or even tabloid) reported the story. Moreover the image originated with a 2010 news story in Australia not a 2017 deathbed confession in the United Kingdom. The MI5 agent deathbed confession story was not the first of its type proffered by YourNewsWire a site known for promoting baseless conspiracy theories.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN In December 2015 the city of Riviera Beach Florida replaced Old Dixie Highway signs with President Barack Obama Highway signs renaming a stretch of road to honor the nations first black president. In January 2018 a year into the Trump administration and following months of protests discussion and debate around the removal of Confederate statues and signs a series of fake news articles were published bearing headlines that heavily insinuated President Donald Trump was ordering that this stretch of Florida highway revert from the President Barack Obama Highway (or as the articles referred to the thoroughfare the Obama Highway) back to its old name. These headlines and articles appeared on a number of dubious and nearly identically formatted web sites; for example ConservativeDaily.info JournalUnited.com WalkWithTimeAmerica.com and AmericanPrides.org all published articles under headlines asking if readers supported Trumps decision: Trump Orders to Remove Obama Highway Name and Get Back The Previous Name of `Old Dixie Highway?Do you support him? If you never read past the misleading headlines you would never know that the articles dont actually report on any official orders to rename this stretch of road instead expressing an opinion that the highways name should be changed back and offering a number of extremely questionable arguments as to why it would be justified: There is nothing racist with either Dixie or Confederate monuments. They are part of the American history and are part of a rich culture that goes beyond whatever bad liberals may want to attach to it. To arbitrarily decide that President Obama may be more relevant to American History than hundreds of years of heritage is ludicrous. On top of that Obama has never done anything for equality in America. President Donald Trump did not announce in January 2018 that he was changing the name of the President Barack Obama Highway in Florida back to the Old Dixie Highway. This rumor stems from poorly titled opinion pieces and not genuine news articles. It also bears mentioning that Riviera Beach Florida is far from the only city in the United States with a roadway named in honor of the countrys first black president.",,0,0,,

ABC downplayed the bombshell admission by presenting Nelsons forgery as merely notes added to the inscription Moore allegedly wrote in her yearbook. In addition ABC reporter Tom Llamas coached Nelson in the interview and put words in her mouth in an obvious effort to downplay the enormous significance of her deceit. Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription. But the message was all Roy Moore Llamas leads. Beverly he signed your yearbook states Llamas. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson replies. After Nelson admitted forgery of the document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News just moved on. Without asking her why she lied or why it took so long for her to come forward with the truth Llamas let the matter slide. Nelson has made emotional public claims that Moore attempted to sexually assault her when she was just 16-years-old. Nelson and her attorney Gloria Allred are planning a news conference Friday but the forgery admission is already out there. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama said Breitbart News. The publication pointed out that Nelson has a motive: As a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis for weeks and now its clear why that request was rejected and ignored. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore: Leigh Corfman claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfmans living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores other accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. Thanks to New Medias going behind the discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know Johnson did not tell the entire truth according to Breitbart. She was not in Moores office on business. If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an unfit absent and unstable mother.

To see more stories like this sign up below for Dennis Michael Lynchs email newsletter.,CLAIM A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doctor said the flu vaccine is causing the deadly flu epidemic. False RATING False ORIGIN On 15 January 2018 disreputable conspiracy disseminator YourNewsWire.com falsely reported that the flu shot was unsafe quoting an unnamed CDC doctor who cautioned that some of his patients had died after receiving it: A CDC doctor has warned this years disastrous flu shot may be responsible for the deadly flu epidemic sweeping the country. Some of the patients Ive administered the flu shot to this year have died the doctor said adding I dont care who you are this scares the crap out of me. We have seen people dying across the country of the flu and one thing nearly all of them have in common is they got the flu shot. Scientists were worried this years flu season was going to be rough and their fears have been proven well founded. The flu season is off to a record-breaking start with the CDC reporting widespread flu activity from coast to coast. Many health officials believe that 2018 will ultimately be the worst flu outbreak that we have experienced since 1918. The CDC doctors experience of patients dying of the flu after receiving the flu shot is sadly not uncommon. Eight Santa Barbara County residents have died from the flu in the last fortnight. Seven of them had the flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in fact urges Americans to get the flu vaccine every year. They also maintain that the shot is largely safe for most people. YourNewsWire employed the fake CDC doctor quote to bridge two facts and make it appear as if one were the cause of the other. It is true the 2017-2018 flu season has been the worst one in years and this seasons flu vaccine has been less effective than in the recent years. So not only is this years flu strain (H3N2) more rampant but the main weapon against its spread isnt holding it at bay. But the fake CDC doctor quoted in YourNewsWires story gives the false impression that flu shots are the cause of the epidemic when in reality theyre simply a preventative measure that is more effective in some years than others. (And of course no fake health scare story would be complete without an anti-vaccine treatise so YourNewsWire faithfully lined up a number of debunked claims about the flu shots dangers.) Its significant to note that YourNewsWire often uses fictional quotes juice up the clickbait value of their stories sometimes for the purpose of putting outrageous words in celebritiess mouths and other times to invent stories and attribute them to convenientlyanonymous witnesses or officials. There is no evidence any CDC doctor exclusively spoke to YourNewsWire a site that traffics in bogus information and shamelessly churns out false articles about medical issues. A linked Santa Barbara Independent newspaper article referenced in the YourNewsWire yarn only reported that eight people had died of the flu in that area over a two-week period but did not report that seven of the eight victims died because of receiving flu shots. In the past YourNewsWire has been the source of or helped spread a long string of persistent rumors including the bogus claim that a terror attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester England was a false flag or a government plot designed to keep the populace in fear. They also reported the widespread (but completely false) rumor that a second gunman helped carry out the mass shooting in Las Vegas on 1 October 2017.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN The night of 16 January 2018 was an odd one in Michigan. Not only did a meteor flash across the sky causing a small earthquake but a garage went up in flames and over the border in Ohio an oil refinery conducted a controlled burn all at the same time. As images of these three events started to make their way around the Internet conspiracy theorists concocted a bizarre explanation that tied them all together: the government (or possibly aliens or maybe both) had unleashed a direct energy weapon on the world: The web site Before Its News collected some of the most compelling images and summarized the theory: The Rod of God. A Directed Energy Weapon. Main stream presstituts will have you believe this was a meteor a meteor that fell at a perfect 90* angle. SMH.. This just happened a few hours ago in Taylor Michigan. 01/16/18. This energy blast was seen and heard in 4 US states and Canada. The United States Geological Survey reports a 2.0 magnitude earthquake at 8:09 p.m. January 16 2018 exactly the same time a meteor flashed through the sky in Michigan. The earthquake was a very weak earthquake having what is called a local magnitude (Ml) of 2.0. This USGS map shows a meteorite notation for the quake. A 2.0 magnitude earthquake would not be felt by humans. This is confusing because all the Meteor videos I can find for this day on YouTube show something else entirely than these photographs. The videos show like a regular ole meteor going thru the air. But these pictures show a percise ray of energy beamed down lighting the ground on fire. Could this be the same tech causing the wildfires all over the USA aka California etc? I dont know. That is why I am sharing this for discussion. A meteor really was visible over Michigan on 16 January 2018. This was confirmed by the United States Geologic Society NASA the National Weather Service astronomy experts and a number of eyewitness videos: Its also true that the videos of the meteor passing over Michigan do not resemble the photographs that appeared to show a ray of light. But thats because those photographs dont actually show the meteor. The center photograph in the collage above was most likely taken near a garage fire in the city of Taylor Michigan. As news of the fire spread so did rumors that the blaze was caused by a meteor crashing into the garage. Michigan news outlet MLive published a story about the phenomena informing worried readers that the blaze was not actually started by a meteor crashing into it: A fire that destroyed a pickup truck inside a garage in the metro Detroit community of Taylor was not started by a piece of falling meteor fragment. Fire crews were called to a garage fire at about 8:24 p.m. Jan. 16 on Merrick Road after the homeowner noticed smoke coming from the engine compartment of a pickup he was working on inside the garage according to the Taylor Fire Department. Images showing a bright streak of light soaring up into the sky likely show an oil refinery in Ohio conducting a controlled burn which caused light pillars (a visual effect that can occur in very cold winter weather) to appear in the sky. A number of people captured images of this refinery fire and the resulting light pillars: Local news outlets such as Click On Detroit<Cleveland 19 and Fox 2 Detroit all published articles in January 2018 about these light pillars forming: They look like lights from an alien spaceship but they are actually light pillars a spectacular sight most commonly seen during the colder winter months. The phenomenons name describes narrow rods that appear to extend from the sky to the ground. Although the images do show something that resembles alien weapons used in movies such as Independence Day these particular photographs do not document the deployment of such a device. Rather the light pillars just happened to appear around the same time that a meteor was spotted streaking across the sky in Michigan creating the perfect conditions for conspiracy theorists to spread rumors about otherworldly weaponry.",,0,0,,

While clicking the links leads to a page that clearly says the news is fake (and makes fun of readers for believing it) many people dont click through before commenting and sharing.

False RATING False ORIGIN On 9 January 2018 the web site Americas Last Line of Defense published an article reporting that University of Alabama running back Bo Scarbrough lost his scholarship over an anti-Trump outburst: When President Trump attended the NCAA national football championship game Monday he just wanted to see some football but the players decided to bring politics to the game especially Atlanta running back Bo Scarbrough who won liberals hearts by acting like the trash he is. Video that has gone viral among unpatriotic scumbags shows Scarbrough screaming fuck Trump as he walks with his team to the field. Other unidentified players joined in. While Scarbrough may have thought his outburst was funny school administrators didnt. According to University of Alabama president Mark Heller the decision was made to remove Mr. Scarborough from the team following his outburst which does not represent the values of this institution. The background to this report was the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship held in Atlanta on 8 January 2018 during which with President Trump in attendance No. 4 Alabama toppled No. 3 Georgia in a thrilling overtime win to clinch the national college football championship. The event was somewhat marred by a controversial viral video clip recorded as Alabama Crimson Tide players were walking between the field and the locker room during which a player said to be Alabama running back Bo Scarbrough was captured purportedly shouting F*ck Trump! The audio from the clip was far from clear however and Scarborough maintained that he had actually yelled F*ck Georgia!: Alabama RB Bo Scarbrough yells F Trump before tonights title game. pic.twitter.com/RhuhRyNFHh Sporting News (@sportingnews) January 9 2018 Regardless of what Bo Scarbrough may or may not have said during the referenced outburst the University of Alabama has not announced any revocation of any scholarship Scarbrough might currently hold or his removal from the football team. In fact the president of the University of Alabama is Dr. Stuart R. Bell not Mark Heller as reported in the Americas Last Line of Defense article. Additionally Scarbrough is reportedly planning to skip his senior year at Alabama to enter the NFL draft in which case the penalties putatively aimed at him would have no effect anyway.

False RATING False ORIGIN In late November 2017 several unreliable web sites published identical articles reporting that a zookeeper at the San Diego Zoo had been arrested and charged with sexual assault on a 15-year-old male gorilla. The story appears to have originated on World News Daily Report which reported: Akimbo Obwebwe a 29-year-old zoo intern originally from Gabon was found guilty of feeding sedatives to Big George one of the zoos top attractions and partaking in sexual activity with the sedated animal. According to unreleased video footage Obwebwe proceeded to insert the animals penis inside his mouth for several minutes but apparently underestimated the strength of the medication leading the animal to wake up and lash back at the zookeeper alerting other employees. Although Mr. Obwebwe claims the sexual relationship was consensual video footage clearly shows he attempted to sedate the animal Adam Simmons a San Diego Zoo spokesman told reporters. We found no mention of such an arrest in any mainstream news source however including the San Diego Union-Tribune which frequently reports on major and minor happenings at the zoo. This should not come as a surprise given that WNDR describes its content as satirical and virtually everything on the web site is fiction: All characters appearing in the articles in this website even those based on real people are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons living dead or undead is purely a miracle. Bestiality appears to be a favorite theme of the WNDR staff whose previous articles include fabricated reports of humans sexually assaulting octopuses alligators and orangutans. Although some might find them repetitive and unfunny these lurid stories presumably serve their commercial purpose of attracting clicks and earning advertising dollars. Parenthetically the mugshot used in the WNDR article is a purposely distorted image of a black male that has been used on racist web sites for years to insult and demean people of color.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 15 January 2018 DailyWire.com the right-wing web site headed by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro posted an article falsely reporting that Mohammed was the most popular name given to baby boys born in the Netherlands in 2017: The mainstream media in the Netherlands reported last week that Noah was the most popular baby name for boys in the small European nation. Noah and Emma were the most popular childrens names in the past year reported Nos.nl. This is evident from the annual list of names of the Social Insurance Bank which pays out the child benefit. Boys were named Noah 635 times while 755 girls went through life as Emma since last year. The year before Daan and Anna were the most popular names the site said. But a journalist at Powned.tv did a little research on the report and found something completely different. Checking for Mohammed and all its alternative spellings the writer found that 636 babies had been given that name last year. PowNed.tv the web site DailyWire.com aggregated their story from is a Dutch blog owned by GeenStijl a right-leaning site that boasts about being needlessly offensive. Both GeenStijl and PowNed.tv have been criticized for posting anti-Muslim and anti-migrant content. Baby names in the Netherlands are recorded by the Social Insurance Bank (SVB) for social service purposes and each year SVB releases a list of the most popular names and ranks them. (For example Noah and Emma were the most popular boys and girls names in 2017 while Daan and Anna were the most popular in 2016.) PowNed arrived at their conclusion that Mohammed was the most popular boys name for 2017 by tallying all of that names variations and then weighing that total against the number of newborns who were named Noah in 2017 a system thats flawed for obvious reasons. SVB ranks names by specific spellings so if the variant spellings of any one name are tallied together that approach changes the ranking order. Thus Mohammad may be a less popular name on its own than Morris or Moos but when all the different spellings of Mohammed are considered together that name is more popular than either: Its true that if multiple variant spellings of the name Mohammed are entered into the SVB database then the results document that 636 of the babies born in the Netherlands in 2017 were given that name. But if the same rule were applied to for example the names Lucas and Daniel it would be clear that Mohammed was hardly the most popular boys name in 2017. Almost 2000 Dutch children were named for some form of Lucas while more than 1000 were given a variation of the name Daniel in 2017. The topic of migration in Europe has attracted the attention of nationalists and white supremacists particularly since 2015 when the number of people seeking refuge from places like Iraq Afghanistan and Syria spiked. European countries have been the targets of false stories claiming that migrants are creating rape capitals and no-go zones. DailyWire.com has a tendency to share stories that are taken out of context or not verified. For example in the days after a violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville Virginia in August 2017 the site helped spread a false rumor that leftists were digging up Confederate graves. In March of that year the site spread a false claim that Democratic lawmakers refused to stand for a fallen Navy SEALs widow. In May 2017 the site falsely reported that Harvard University was holding segregated commencement ceremonies. The site was embroiled in another racial controversy after posting a video disparaging Native Americans in October 2017.

False RATING False ORIGIN Since at least 2016 fake news purveyors have been attempting to paint actor Denzel Washington as a staunch support of President Donald Trump. In August of that year for example untrustworthy web sites falsely claimed that the actor shocked Hollywood when he switched sides to support the Republican candidate for president. The utterly disreputable YourNewsWire.com took a different approach to this long-running lie in a December 2017 article in which they claimed that Washington had criticized Trumps predecessor Barack Obama as the criminal-in-chief: Former president Barack Obama ran the United States like a banana republic as criminal-in-chief and enriched himself and his cronies at the expense of the rest of the country according to Denzel Washington. Federal debt skyrocketed under Obama. He was printing money by the end of his reign. This is unheard of in our history. He ran the country like a banana republic said Denzel Washington at a New York screening of his new film the legal drama Roman J. Israel Esq. Asked by a reporter whether his information about Obama was correct Denzel Washington confirmed that it was absolutely correct. He also criticized mainstream media for attempting to turn Obama into a kind of idol. This is not a genuine quote from Denzel Washington. YourNewsWire.com has a long history of publishing inflammatory misinformation conspiracy theories and fake news. No credible outlets documented the actor saying this and the actors publicist confirmed to Media Matters that the story was completely fictitious. Despite the disreputable source for this quote the article was widely shared as genuine news by several people on social media. CNN law enforcement analyst Harry Houck lent some faux credibility to the article when he shared it on Facebook along with the caption without a doubt. Houck later replaced the story and with a message apologizing for the error I apologize for retweeting a fake news story re: Denzel Washington I didnt even read before deleting the post entirely.

However those links were just another iteration of the Company Anniversary Free Product scam in which scammers establishi fake Facebook accounts mimicking those of well-known vendors of consumer products.

The scammers spread links via e-mail and Facebook that purport to offer free product to those who follow those links. These web pages (which are not operated or sponsored by the companies they reference) typically ask the unwary to click what appear to be Facebook share buttons and post comments to the scammers site (which is really a ruse to dupe users into spreading the scam by sharing it with all of their Facebook friends).

Mixture RATING Mixture WHATS TRUE California has implemented a law providing for the automatic voter registration of motorists who obtain or renew drivers licenses and critics contend that the law will make it easier for non-citizens to unlawfully vote. WHATS FALSE California has not implemented a law authorizing non-citizens to vote in federal elections. ORIGIN In February 2016 California officials announced that more than 600000 undocumented people were granted drivers licenses in 2015 (the first year after AB 60 took effect): Some 605000 undocumented immigrants who live in California were granted drivers licenses in 2015 the first year they have been able to enjoy that benefit officials said. The law known as AB60 took effect on January 2 2015. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) expects a total of about 1.4 million people will get their license under the law by late 2017. Governor Jerry Brown a Democrat signed the law in October 2013 to give a legal document to the 2.5 million undocumented immigrants in California alone most from Latin America and particularly neighboring Mexico. That announcement renewed interest in another California law the New Motor Voter Act which was passed in October 2015. The combination of these two acts one allowing undocumented residents to obtain drivers licenses the other automatically registering citizens to vote when obtaining drivers licensse sparked fears (which have been periodically resurrected for more than a decade) that California was allowing undocumented residents to vote. Judge Andrew Napolitano gave a voice to these fears during an appearance on Fox & Friends: Judge Andrew Napolitano says that if you are an illegal alien in California get a drivers license register to vote you can vote in local state and federal elections in California and those votes count. On Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy explained The state of California has passed legislation that will automatically register eligible voters when they obtain or renew a drivers license. Governor Jerry Brown says its a way to increase voter turnout but critics warn the measure could add millions of illegal people to the rolls because the state allows undocumented aliens to get drivers licenses. But neither Assembly Bill 60 nor the New Motor Voter Act provide undocumented immigrants with any additional federal benefits: California officials believe the program which does not give license holders any US federal benefits does make roads in the most populous US state safer several state sources said. It does not allow license holders for example the right to fly on airplanes inside the United States nor does it give anyone legal residency status the right to work or to seek a US passport. The law requires that applicants under the Motor Voter Act attest that they meet all voter registration requirements but critics maintain that the law lacks the necessary safeguards to keep noncitizens off the voter rolls. Although those critics fear that undocumented residents may slip through the loopholes and becomes registered to vote its not accurate to say that California has made it legal for undocumented residents to vote. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla asserted that the motor voter registration process was more secure than the existing automated registration procedure: The way automatic registration works is relatively simple: Eligible citizens are registered to vote when they show up at a Department of Motor Vehicles office to obtain a drivers license or state ID. The DMV gives the eligible voter a chance to opt out if they prefer not to register. If the person does not opt out the DMV electronically transfers their voter registration information to the Secretary of States office rather than making election officials enter data by hand from paper registration forms Automated voter registration is actually a more secure way of doing things California Secretary of State Alex Padilla told HuffPost. Potential voters have to demonstrate proof of age the vast majority of time people are showing a birth certificate or a passport which also reflects citizenship. Thats arguably more secure than someone checking a box under penalty of perjury Padilla said. Initially the law required that the state implement the California New Motor Voter Program by 1 January 2020 but a lawsuit over the issue resulted in a legislative amendation that pushed the date forward to April 2018. While its true that undocumented residents living in California can obtain drivers licenses the state has not passed any laws that also provide them the right to vote. The New Motor Voter Act was passed in an effort to improve voter turnout and while this law does automatically register citizens to vote when they obtain or renew their drivers licenses that action only applies to citizens who have already attested and/or documented an eligibility to vote.,,0,0,,

She listed his time of death at 12:19 p.m. The address where Eberweins body was discovered according to police 14501 S. Dixie Hwy. is a Quality Inn. it appears that Eberwein had fallen on hard times. An Uber spokesperson confirmed that he worked as a driver for awhile in South Florida. The portion of the article that caught the attention of conspiracy blogs was about allegations of fraud and corruption faced by Eberwein about FAES management of funds. The paper made no mention of Clinton or the Clinton Foundation: Eberwein was scheduled to appear Tuesday before the Haitian Senates Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission the head of the commission Sen. Evalire Beauplan confirmed. The commission is investigating the management of PetroCaribe funds the money Haiti receives from Venezuelas discounted oil program. By 14 July 2017 internet sleuths got wind of the news and perhaps inevitably built on it: A separate blog post on the same day summarized the Heralds report then made an uncited and unsourced claim about Eberweins scheduled appearance at a 18 July 2017 hearing: Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors. According to Miami-Dades medical examiner records supervisor the official cause of death is gunshot to the head. Eberweins death has been registered as suicide. Eberwein who had acknowledged his life was in danger was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundations activities in the Caribbean island where he served as director general of the governments economic development agency Fonds dassistance conomique et social for three years. The outlet originally reported that Eberwein was slated to appear in relation to a probe into the management of PetroCaribe funds the money Haiti receives from Venezuelas discounted oil program. We were unable to find a credible link to Eberweins involvement in the hearing; the same unsourced claim was repeated by a blog called the Haiti Sentinel. However many readers citing that site failed to recognize that the Haiti Sentinel article came after the other pieces and that it based its claims upon them: As it turns out however the article from YourNewsWire from which the Haiti Sentinel piece was written is suspect containing a quote from Eberwein the only part of the article that linked him to the Clintons to begin with that was actually spoken by someone else: The Clinton Foundation they are criminals they are thieves they are liars they are a disgrace Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year. Someone did say that outside Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan in November 2016 but YourNewsWire appears to have for some reason confused one person of Haitian descent with another. The actual person who spoke this phrase is a community activist and New York area radio host named Dahdoud Andr and this comment originally appeared in a BBC article: The Clinton family they are crooks they are thieves they are liars says Haitian activist Dahoud Andre. He has been leading protests outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan and Hillary Clintons presidential campaign base in Brooklyn for the last two years. He said protesters from his small activist group the Committee to Mobilize Against Dictatorship in Haiti will continue to level their allegations so far all unproven if the Democratic candidate wins the White House. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump raised the matter in the third and final presidential debate when he told Mrs Clinton: I was at a Little Haiti the other day in Florida. And I want to tell you they hate the Clintons because whats happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace. Andr despite the attempts to stir suspicion remains very much alive as of July 2017 and pointed out to us that Eberwein had nothing to do with any protests against the Clintons that he had helped organize. (It appears YourNewsWire took some liberties with the false quote as well weaving Donald Trumps assessment of the Clinton Foundation into Andrs.) As we have noted before allegations about Hillary Clinton the Clinton Foundation and corruption in Haiti are not new nor are they fully substantiated: Related rumors of the Clintons relationship to Haiti appeared in October 2016 this time alleging that after the Haitis infrastructure was devastated by a major earthquake in 2010 the State Department steered relief contracts to personal friends of the Clintons. However while Hillary Clinton did recommend specific companies to help with the rebuilding process and e-mails have surfaced indicating that special attention was given to FoBs (Friends of Bill) theres no evidence that the United States government awarded contracts to any of those contenders. In 2014 Eberwein lamented slow progress in Haiti following a 2010 earthquake despite an outpouring of aid to the country and claims about the Clintons influence in Haiti are not limited to career Clinton critics. In 2015 Politico reported: one person even closer to the secretary of state was singing a different tunevery very quietly after a four-day visit to the quake zone Chelsea Clinton authored a seven-page memo which she addressed to Dad Mom and copied their chief aides. That informal report tells a continuing story of the unique brands of power and intelligence wielded by the Clinton family in Haiti and around the worldand of the uniquely Clinton ways they often undermine themselves. Chelsea Clinton was blunt in her report confident the recipients would respect her request in the memos introduction to remain an invisible soldier. She had first come to the quake zone six days after the disaster with her father and then-fianc Mark Mezvinsky. Now she was returning with the medical aid group Partners in Health whose co-founder Dr. Paul Farmer was her fathers deputy in his Office of the UN Special Envoy for Haiti. What she saw profoundly disturbed her. The Clintons role in what was frequently framed as a bungled-at-best relief effort was described in a September 2016 Slate piece: Here is an island country of 10 million people where Americas ultimate power couple invested considerable time and reputation. Here is a fragile state where each took turns implementing destructive policies whose highlights include overthrowing a presidential election. Bill Clinton in particular mixed personal relationships business and unaccountable power in ways that if never exactly criminal arouse the kind of suspicion that erodes public trust. No two individuals including Haitis own leaders enjoyed more power and influence than the Clintons in the morass of the failed reconstruction following the deadly Jan. 12 2010 earthquake when a troubled country managed to go from catastrophe to worse. The claim about Eberweins purportedly suspicious suicide bore a strong resemblance to similar rumors involving former U.N. official John Ashe in 2016. Ashe purportedly died before he could testify against Clinton in the summer of that year. Although insiders have repeatedly stated that Ashe was never scheduled to testify against Clinton his name regularly appears on lists of those allegedly murdered by the Clintons or their associates. Before news of Klaus Eberweins suicide was reported on 12 July 2017 no reports said or even hinted that any probe in which he was involved targeted Hillary Clinton or the Clinton Foundation. The claim originated on the frequently disreputable YourNewsWire.com and was uncritically repeated and amplified by readers and blogs. However we have found no specific information tying Eberwein to Clinton before his July 2017 death. We attempted to contact both the original Herald writer as well as Sen. Evalire Beauplan to verify the link or lack thereof but have not yet received a response from either.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN Oprah Winfrey delivered a rousing speech on racial and gender equality while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Globes ceremony on 7 January 2018 prompting media speculation about a future political career including a possible 2020 presidential bid. It also prompted the spread of derogatory rumors by her detractors. One such rumor centered on comments Winfrey made during a 2013 BBC interview in which she was asked whether or not she believes the problem of racism has been solved. Her alleged response? In order for the problem of racism to be solved old white people have to die. Heres an example of a tweet asserting that Winfrey said it: Oprahs solution to racism; Old white people just have to die. What a horribly divisive message. pic.twitter.com/NOtaft2xxf Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) January 8 2018 This way of framing Winfreys 2013 remarks isnt new. Among other places we also encountered it on the xenophobic fake news web site Jews News in May 2015: Oprah Winfrey: White older people have to die Oprah Winfrey is looked up to by millions of mindless followers. This clip shows her racist side. Oprah believes that older white people are the problem with America today and that they need to die so that racism can end. And one finds similar statements in sources contemporaneous with the BBC interview such as this article published in FrontPage Magazine in November 2013: Oprah: Racism Will End When All the Old White People Die And if you dont think that old white people should die then youre a racist. Because what could be more racist than planning a post-racial utopia that depends on people of a certain race dying. Despite whats stated above however Winfreys remarks werent specifically targeted at white people. She did not say All old white people have to die or White older people have to die or any other fabricated race-based version of her actual remarks. In fact she never uttered the phrase white people at all. Here is the full BBC interview: WINFREY: It would be foolish to not recognize that we have evolved and that were not still facing the same kind of terrorism against black people en masse as was displayed with the Scottsboro boys. Its gotten better. Are there still places where people are terrorized because of the color of their skin because of the color of their black skin? Yes. But there are laws that have allowed us to progress beyond what we saw in the Scottsboro Boys and beyond even prejudice that we see in The Butler. I mean his ability to go in One of my favorite scenes ever spoiler alert is him going in and asking for the raise. I think thats one of the finest acting jobs Ive ever seen. You know that moment? INTERVIEWER: Of course. Are you saying problem solved? WINFREY: Im saying problem not solved. Im saying that you know thats the beauty of a film like The Butler and its the beauty of a film like 12 Years a Slave and its the beauty of what were seeing on stage with Scottsboro Boys it allows people to see where the root of the problem started. It allows people to see Oh thats where it all started this is how far weve come and now this is how much farther we need to go. Of course the problem is not solved. As long as people can be judged by the color of their skin the problems not solved. As long as there are people who still And theres a whole generation I said this for apartheid South Africa I said this for my own community in the South there are still generations of people older people who were born and bred and marinated in it in that prejudice and racism and they just have to die. Its valid given the context to infer that the majority of the people Winfrey was talking about are white but invalid to infer that her remarks targeted all older white people or only older white people. In other words those accusing Winfrey of racism draw a false equivalence between generations marinated in racism and all older white people. However contentious and impolitic it may have been for Winfrey to claim that older generations steeped in prejudice will have to die before the problem of racism can be solved the objection that it was racist of her to say so is absurd.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN The official guest list for the royal wedding of Englands Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had not been released as of early December 2017 but that didnt stop disreputable web sites from inventing politically-charged stories about who would and wouldnt be invited. The pro-Trump fake news site Just News USA reported on 3 December 2017 that despite kissing up to the royal family and trying to sneak an invitation to Harrys wedding former United States President and First Lady Barack and Michelle Obama had been personally removed from the guest list by Queen Elizabeth: For eight years Michelle Obama genuinely thought she was a queen and expected to be treated like one. Now that shes a regular citizen shes having a hard time of letting go of her former status as the (failed) first lady and keeps trying to push her way into every major social scene where she doesnt belong and is apparently not invited. When she heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl she assumed it was her place to be on that guest list which has to be approved by the Queen of England herself. Michelle made a desperation move to sneak a spot on that exclusive guest list and as soon as the real queen found out what the wannabe royalty did she delivered a brutal beatdown that was definitely deserved. Several other sites including the consistently unreliable YourNewsWire.com published slightly rearranged versions of the same article. For example: Invitations to Royal weddings in England have traditionally been extended to the sitting President of the United States and the current First Lady so when Queen Elizabeth saw what Michelle Obama was up to trying to sneak a spot at the wedding at the expense of the real POTUS and FLOTUS she delivered Michelle a well-deserved and humiliating beatdown. While Barack Obama has been traveling around the world operating as some kind of shadow president and attempting to undermine the real POTUS Michelle has been trying to push her way into every major social event where she doesnt belong and is apparently not invited. When Michelle Obama heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl she assumed it was her rightful place to be on that guest list. Michelle made a desperate move to sneak a spot on the guest list but unfortunately for the former First Lady the guest list has to be approved by the Queen of England herself. There was no basis in fact for any of these claims. As of 30 November (just a few days before these reports began appearing) word from Kensington Palace was that the guest list was still in the early stages of being compiled according to the Telegraph and the royal betrothed would have primary input into who would be on that list. No mainstream news sources in England or anywhere else reported that the Obamas were on the outs with Queen Elizabeth nor that the queen intended to disinvite them or other potential wedding guests. As a matter of fact if anyone was likely to be disinvited it would probably be President Trump judging from the Telegraphs report for two reasons: one because it would go against the established precedent which is not to invite sitting U.S. presidents to British royal weddings; and two because bride-to-be Meghan Markle who is an American is not a big fan of Trump whom she has called misogynistic and divisive. The Obamas on the other hand have enjoyed a comparatively warm relationship with the royal family ever since 2009 when the then-First Lady broke with protocol and hugged the queen during their first meeting. Barack Obama was seen hanging out with groom-to-be Prince Harry as recently as May 2017: Prince Harry hosted former US President @BarackObama at Kensington Palace today. pic.twitter.com/9SWfSRY4FH Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 27 2017 A 27 November 2017 article in Newsweek told a story very different from what would be reported by Just News USA and other fake news sites days later:",,0,0,,

Check back daily new pictures are added all the time!,CLAIM Beyonc revealed that according to a DNA test she is related to the Rockefellers and the British royal family. False RATING False ORIGIN On 16 January 2018 YourNewsWire.com a regular disseminator of hoaxes and fake news regurgitated another round of Illuminati conspiracy theories by stacking them under a fake story about singer Beyonc. Its article pushed the claim that the Texas native had boasted that her stardom was the result not of her work but her family lineage: Revealing that a DNA test kit given to her by Gwyneth Paltrows 13-year-old daughter Apple Martin opened up a whole new world to me and created my obsession with tracing my family tree Beyonce told close friends and associates on Jay-Zs Family Feud video shoot that her family is closely related to the Bush family Rockefeller dynasty and the Queen of England. We are related to the Rockefellers on my Moms side. I thought that was something but we are also not-so-distant cousins of the British Royal Family Beyonce boasted. Like virtually everything else on YourNewsWire.com this statement is a fabrication. While the story states that its account is based on reports it does not link to any report that could corroborate its account. Even if it were true the concept of the Illuminati a shadowy group of people who purportedly control the world has been roundly debunked time and again and being related to (for example) the Bush family and the Rockefellers would not be the same as confessing membership in that group. There is however a social connection between Beyonc and Gwyneth Paltrow; their daughter have celebrated birthdays together. Also Paltrows ex-husband Chris Martin of Coldplay backed up Beyonc during her halftime performance at Super Bowl 50 in February 2016. Conservatives have openly resented the former Destinys Child singer for incorporating a tribute to the Black Lives Matter movement. It is perhaps worth noting that Your News Wire once also ran a story about Beyonc claiming that she had demonstrated her reptilian shapeshifting powers at Serena Williams wedding and indeed seems to be convinced that many celebrities are casually changing form at random saying so in a series of articles that are so similar that it seems that only a few names and details have been changed. Naturally each article offers up proof in the forms of links to pages that dont exist then immediately claims that the articles (or images or hashtags) that showed that evidence have all mysteriously disappeared.,,0,0,,

Simply listen to her latest uncontrolled rant on Twitter where she publicly bribed two Republican legislators to change their vote for the sum of $2-million. The incident took place Tuesday night when the former funny lady took to Twitter and offered both Susan Collins (R-ME) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) the bribe if they would cast a no vote on the impending Trump Tax Bill that would benefit over 80% of taxpayers allowing them to keep more of their own money. ODonnell like most progressive Ideologues was already feeling the burn as the GOPs historic tax bill won the approval of both the House and Senate (on a party-line vote) and it was just a matter of time before she completely lost it by first tweeting out the bribe offer; so how about this I promise to give 2 million dollars to Senator Susan Collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NONO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUPER RICH ODonnell continued: DM me Susan DM me jeffno shit 2 million cash each. so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 ODonnell continued on a profane rant targeting Rep.

Do you think ODonnell like most of the loony celebrity left should finally be held accountable for her actions? Comments comments,CLAIM Singer Katy Perry said everyone should try praying to Satan. False RATING False ORIGIN Your New Wire notorious purveyor of fake news and inventor of ridiculous celebrity quotes reported in January 2018 that singer Katy Perry had recommended people pray to Satan to experience a whole extra level of amazing. YourNewsWire reported that Perry made the comments at a fashion event in Los Angeles on 16 January 2018: Experiencing Satans raw power is something everybody should experience at least once in their lifetime according to Katy Perry who advised fans to add praying to Satan to your bucket list. People who say theyll try anything once are usually full of shit. How do I know this? Because if they tried praying to Satan just once theyd be doing it every day. Multiple times per day. Its really that powerful. Its a real trip. Speaking at a Stella McCartney fashion event in Los Angeles on Tuesday Katy Perry denied rumors that she has undergone plastic surgery and instead attributed her refreshed look to a new spiritual outlook. Advising everybody to add praying to Satan to your bucket list Katy Perry compared her first time praying to Satan to a mythical movie When Beckie Met Chad. There is no evidence that the singer made these comments although Perry did attend the star-studded Stella McCartney Stellabration fashion event and party in Los Angeles. She has often been the focus of moral panic-tinged occult rumors perhaps fueled by her professional progression from Christian-themed musician to sometimes-risque pop singer who campaigned for 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (who is also often the focus of satanism and occult hoaxes). Perrys only on-the-record comment at the event that we could find was to the style and culture publication The Cut: [Stella McCartney] is the definition of good vibrations. Really Stella her work is so phenomenal but she is such a good vibe. Its just always fun thats why we come because its not work. The clothes are so great theyre just so architectural this season and its just a big fat get together where we can be ourselves conversate and meet again. Im on the road so Im not able to go to a lot of these things so its fun for me tonight. YourNewsWire often concocts false celebrity quotes though in recent days theyve given Perry special focus. On 10 January 2018 the site falsely claimed that she along with Meryl Streep and Chesea Clinton were members of an elite cannibal club. They also falsely reported in January 2018 that singer Dolly Parton blamed Californias recent weather-related to disasters on Satan worship. One month earlier they falsely claimed that actor Denzel Washington had referred to former U.S. President Barack Obama as the criminal-in-chief.,,0,0,,

It began with marginally talented comedian Kathy Griffin holding the bloody mock decapitated head of Donald Trump the gory photo made international news mimicking the brutal beheadings by radical Islamic extremists and although her actions prompted a visit from the Secret Service there was no accountability. A short time later there was ageing pop-tart Madonna wearing a pink pussy hat at the womans march in Washington threatening to blow-up the White House which once again prompted a visit from the Secret Service however there were no consequences likewise when an unhinged and vile video clip of a thuggish Robert De Niro surfaced apparently doing his best Goodfellas imitation threatening to physically assault the president once again no consequences. However this time over-the-hill comedian Rosie ODonnell could face prison time and a $12-million fine for publicly bribing two Republican senators to change their vote regarding the GOP tax bill. The incident was widely reported on both social media and within the mainstream press detailing how ODonnell took to Twitter hours before the final vote on the tax bill and offered Senators Susan Collins and Jeff Flake 2 million dollars if they changed their vote. so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Even after another user on social media pointed out that she was attempting to bride a government official loudmouth Rosie stood by her illicit offer. i disagree it is obvious there is a price corker had one collins too flake almost brave he crawled out backwards 2 million to any GOP senator who votes no on KILLING AMERICANS MILLIONS WITH OUT HEALTH CARE MY GOD HAVE WE NO SO ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Rosie just kept going with it and wouldnt shut up: heres the thing al i am not looking to give more money to a corrupt system however this bill is criminal i therefore offer 2 million for any GOP senator that votes no to them personally or directed to A NON PROFIT OF THEIR CHOICE no strings attached DO WHATS RIGHT ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Offering a bribe is a federal crime under US Code 18 stating; whoever directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public officialwith intent to influence any official act. The penalty if convicted can range up to 15-years in a federal prison banned for life from elective office or up to a $12-million fine.

True RATING True ORIGIN On 20 January 2018 amid the hue and cry of a federal government shutdown taking effect thanks to failure on Congress to reach a bipartisan deal on a short-term spending bill the two sides passed blame back and forth over the Senate floor like a hot potato. Fox News reported that the sticking point for Democrats was the March 2018 expiration of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program which allows a measure of respite for young people who were born outside the United States and were brought to the country as children and who in many cases have spent years maneuvering a backlogged immigration system in order to be able to apply for citizenship: The deadline arrived without a deal. The U.S. government shut down at midnight Friday after Congress failed to overcome a partisan divide over immigration and spending. In a late-night vote Senate Democrats joined to block a bill that would have kept the government running until mid-February. A flurry of last-minute negotiations failed to produce an agreement. Democrats tried to use the Friday night funding deadline to win concessions from Republicans including an extension of DACA an Obama-era program protecting some young immigrants from deportation. The program is set to expire in March. Republicans sought more time for talks but Democrats refused. The Republican-controlled White House went so far as to change the outgoing message on the White House telephone comment line (202-456-1111) to an unprecedented message blaming Democrats: Thank you for calling the White House. Unfortunately we cannot answer your call today because Congressional Democrats are holding government funding including funding for our troops and other national security priorities hostage to an unrelated immigration debate. Due to this obstruction the government is shut down. In the meantime you can leave a comment for the president at www.whitehouse.gov/contact. We look forward to taking your calls as soon as the government reopens. The existence of the message was confirmed by various reporters: saw this going around and wanted to check for myself: heres the message you hear today when you ring the White House comment line during the shutdown pic.twitter.com/sCquYj0XnX David Mack (@davidmackau) January 20 2018 We called and were able to confirm for ourselves that this was indeed the White Houses outgoing telephone message on 20 January 2018. If no deal is reached by 22 January 2018 thousands of federal employees will be placed on unpaid furloughs as CNN reported: Whoever works for agencies and departments that are considered nonessential including agencies that pay out small business loans and process passport requests will cease to work effective immediately until Congress is able to agree on a bill for the federal budget. The employees in these departments would be placed on furlough. In previous shutdowns everyone who stayed home was paid retroactively after an agreement was reached in Washington. At the peak of the 2013 government shutdown about 850000 employees were furloughed per day according to the Office of Management and Budget. Members of Congress however will still receive full pay.,,0,0,,

True RATING True ORIGIN In January 2018 readers notified us that a number of news outlets had reported that a man in Fresno California had walked into a local emergency room carrying a 5-foot-long tapeworm he said he had pulled out of his own body after experiencing symptoms that included cramping and bloody diarrhea. According to the reports the patient a frequent sushi eater extracted the parasite as best he could after feeling it wiggling in his intestines and wrapped it around a toilet paper tube for transport. He presented it to doctors at Fresnos Community Regional Medical Center and requested immediate treatment for worms. We decided to check the story out for ourselves by contacting the person named as the attending physician Dr. Kenny Banh. Its all true Dr. Banh told us right down to the toilet paper roll. I have seen and treated intestinal worms and parasites before but never had a patient bring in a giant tapeworm he said in an e-mail. By giant he means five-and-a-half feet long. The tapeworm had a flat skinny body tan in color with narrow dark brown lines down its back and a big flat head. Tapeworms are a type of parasitic flatworm (also called cestode) most often taken into the body by eating contaminated raw meat or fish. They reside in the digestive tracts of infected human beings or nonhuman animals where they hold themselves in place using the suckers on their heads and they may or may not cause noticeable symptoms ranging from abdominal discomfort to intestinal blockage. They can grow to more than 30 feet in length. What was Banhs first thought when he saw the creature? Very cool he said. People asked if it was disgusting but as an EM physician I see much worse. This was more geeky scientifically interesting though funny as it was wrapped around a toilet paper roll. Treatment for tapeworms in humans is fairly simple: usually a single dose of an oral antihelminthic a drug that kills the worms similar to the deworming medication you give your pet dog Banh says. Of greater concern to the patient was figuring out how he contracted the tapeworm in the first place. He hadnt been exposed to parasitic infection by travel or by drinking contaminated liquids or by eating raw meat he was sure which really only left one possibility: sushi. The patient said he eats a lot of sushi daily in fact and his favorite dish is salmon sashimi. A bit of Googling confirmed that he was probably right. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a research letter in January 2017 noting that the Japanese broad tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense) has been detected in wild salmon caught along the U.S. and Asian Pacific coasts and that it therefore poses potential dangers for persons who eat these fish raw. For any salmon sashimi addicts reading this that doesnt mean you have give up your habit on pain of contracting a tapeworm infection but it does mean you need to make sure the raw salmon you consume has been handled properly. Freezing kills parasites which is why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that all fish be frozen before it can be served raw anywhere in the United States. If youre not confident your favorite sushi restaurant sources and handles its fish in accordance with the law we trust our little cautionary tale will inspire you to seek out one that does.,,0,0,,

ABC downplayed the bombshell admission by presenting Nelsons forgery as merely notes added to the inscription Moore allegedly wrote in her yearbook. In addition ABC reporter Tom Llamas coached Nelson in the interview and put words in her mouth in an obvious effort to downplay the enormous significance of her deceit. Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription. But the message was all Roy Moore Llamas leads. Beverly he signed your yearbook states Llamas. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson replies. After Nelson admitted forgery of the document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News just moved on. Without asking her why she lied or why it took so long for her to come forward with the truth Llamas let the matter slide. Nelson has made emotional public claims that Moore attempted to sexually assault her when she was just 16-years-old. Nelson and her attorney Gloria Allred are planning a news conference Friday but the forgery admission is already out there. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama said Breitbart News. The publication pointed out that Nelson has a motive: As a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis for weeks and now its clear why that request was rejected and ignored. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore: Leigh Corfman claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfmans living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores other accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. Thanks to New Medias going behind the discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know Johnson did not tell the entire truth according to Breitbart. She was not in Moores office on business. If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an unfit absent and unstable mother. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017,LOS ANGELES (AP) Tom Pettys family says his death last year was due to an accidental drug overdose. His wife and daughter released the results of Pettys autopsy via a statement Friday on his Facebook page. Dana and Adria Petty say they got the results from the coroners office earlier in the day that the overdose was due to a variety of medications. The statement was posted moments before the Los Angeles coroners office issued its official findings which confirmed that Petty had a mix of prescription painkillers sedatives and an antidepressant. Among the medications found in his system were fentanyl and oxycodone. Petty suffered from emphysema a fractured hip and knee problems that caused him pain the family said but he was still committed to touring. He had just wrapped up a tour a few days before he died in October at age 66. The family said Petty had been prescribed various pain medications for his multitude of issues including fentanyl patches and we feel confident that this was as the coroner found an unfortunate accident. They added: As a family we recognize this report may spark a further discussion on the opioid crisis and we feel that it is a healthy and necessary discussion and we hope in some way this report can save lives. Many people who overdose begin with a legitimate injury or simply do not understand the potency and deadly nature of these medications. Painkillers and sedatives are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the U.S. but both drug types slow users heart rate and breathing. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against mixing them because the combination can lead to breathing problems coma and death. Petty was a rock superstar with the persona of an everyman who drew upon the Byrds Beatles and other bands he worshipped as a boy in Gainesville Florida. He produced classics that include Free Fallin Refugee and American Girl. He and his longtime band the Heartbreakers had recently completed a 40th-anniversary tour one he hinted would be their last. The shaggy-haired blond rose to success in the 1970s and went on to sell more than 80 million records. He was loved for his melodic hard rock nasally vocals and down-to-earth style. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame which inducted Petty and the Heartbreakers in 2002 praised them as durable resourceful hard-working likable and unpretentious.,,0,0,,

Susan Collins $2 million cash if she would vote against the bill. Sen. Collins of Maine had voiced support for the GOP tax reform bill and voted in favor of it Tuesday night after securing revisions she requested that would benefit working families. Collins who leans to the left on some issues was ridiculed by the left Tuesday over her support for the tax bill. In an interview with Politico Tuesday she stated I believe that the coverage has been unbelievably sexist and I cannot believe that the press would have treated another senator with 20 years of experience as they have treated me. Theyve ignored everything that Ive gotten and written story after story about how Im duped. How am I duped when all your amendments get accepted?

Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) December 15 2017,CLAIM Dr. Bandy Lee who has warned the United States that Donald Trump is dangerously impaired lacks a medical license. False RATING False ORIGIN On 10 January 2018 an article posted to the web site of white supremacist online radio host Hal Turner reported falsely that Dr. Bandy Lee a renowned psychiatrist and violence expert at Yale University who has been vocal about her views on the deleterious societal effects of President Donald Trumps mental state and presidency did not have a medical license: For months a woman purporting to be an expert in Psychiatry has been unethically remotely diagnosing President Donald Trump and has also been unethically publicly claiming he is emotionally unstable and thus unfit to be President. But a quick look into Dr. Bandy Lee shows she doesnt have a License to practice! As proof of this claim Turner posted a screen shot from a Connecticut professional license database along with triumphal text boasting his purported discovery that Lees physicians license had lapsed: Medical doctors are required to be licensed by the states they practice in and some maintain multiple licenses. So it wouldnt be far-fetched to think that even if Dr. Lee did not have a current license in Connecticut she might hold one in another state. Despite this likelihood and the fact Hal Turner is a brazen white supremacist similar articles raising doubts about the status of Dr. Lees professional license also appeared on larger conservative web sites. First Campus Reform posted the story splashing their proprietary watermark over the public record showing Lees license as lapsed in Connecticut and then the Daily Caller picked it up. Campus Reform a right wing web site funded by the Leadership Institute that trawls the Internet and social media for signs of perceived liberalism on college campuses reported: Yale University psychology professor Bandy Lee has deleted her Twitter account amid mounting allegations that she is not licensed in her home state of Connecticut. Accusations have been circulating on Twitter that the prominent Yale professor known for her public diagnosis of President Donald Trump as having a mental impairment and who recently met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss the issue isnt actually a licensed psychiatrist. Nonetheless Dr. Lee does hold an active physicians license in the state of New York: In a phone interview Dr. Lee told us that the explanation for her lapsed license in Connecticut is a simple one: she previously held medical licenses in three states California Connecticut and New York. (She also held a license in France for five years while working for the Ministry of Justice there.) But because her work as a forensic psychiatrist specializing in violence has led her to perform mostly consultation and policy-oriented work she decided that holding multiple state licences wasnt practical or necessary: I had been maintaining all three [state medical licenses] but it got to be a lot of work so I decided for the consultation work I do that I dont need a licensee in every state I consult in. I held New York Connecticut and California for many years but the Connecticut one I just let go of because in terms of maintenance you have to renew every year and it got cumbersome. In California you have to constantly update [Continued Medical Education]. I kept the New York license because its the easiest to maintain. Peter Fricke editor of Campus Reform (a publication that claims to hold itself to rigorous journalism standards) told us they published the story headlined Records show psych prof who diagnosed Trump lacks license without all the relevant information one would expect in such an article because when they reached out to Dr. Lee she didnt specify which state she was currently licensed in. Nevertheless Fricke told us that he felt it was valuable to report Lee doesnt hold a current Connecticut license because she is on the faculty at Yale (which is in New Haven): She works in Connecticut and she uses her affiliation with Yale University to give relevance to what she does. We havent said anything thats untrue. We did independently verify the status of her license in Connecticut. We were made aware of her story because she had deleted her Twitter account in the wake of the fallout. Lee has become yet another focus of disreputable partisan web sites that help foster online hate from some supporters of President Donald Trump. She found herself in the spotlight most recently after Politico reported on 3 January 2018 that she had traveled to Capitol Hill one month earlier to warn lawmakers that President Trumps instability is a public danger and that it will only get worse as time goes on. Lee also edited the October 2017 book The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President and in mid-January 2018 she authored two op-eds in large publications delineating her concerns. Lee told us she deleted her Twitter account because after gaining the type of toxic hyperpartisan attention that is now commonplace on social media she started receiving death threats which caused her to be so fearful that she now wears a disguise whenever she steps outside. Aside from the political controversy Lee and her cohort made intra-disciplinary waves on 9 January 2018 when the American Psychiatric Association put out a statement calling for an end to armchair psychiatry saying doctors evaluating public figures they have not personally examined violates the Goldwater Rule an ethical principle that guides physician members of the APA to refrain from publicly issuing professional medical opinions about individuals that they have not personally evaluated in a professional setting or context. Lee told us despite this criticism she feels it is in fact unethical for her to remain silent and that it is her professional duty to caution the public about what she and other experts see as a threat:,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN In October 2016 viral entertainment web sites such as Yikes.com published articles positing that two burglars had been sodomized for five straight days after they broke into the house of a notorious gay sex predator named Harry Harrington: Two burglars got more than they bargained for recently after picking the wrong house to break into. Garfield Morgan 54 and his 36 year old accomplice friend Kim Gorton are both career burglars having stolen from hundreds of homes in their lives. But its unlikely theyll go back to crime after the nasty episode they experienced in the home of one Florida man Harry Harrington is 67 and weighs over 300lbs. Its pure muscle. Hes a notorious gay s*x predator who has served time in jail for numerous sexual assaults. An aggressive and predatory offender hes not the kind of man you want to annoy. But thats just what Morgan and Gorton did that fateful night. Harrington known as The Wolfman easily overpowered the men tied them up and assaulted them for five full days. Police only intervened after a neighbor heard the mens cries for help and called them. There was no truth to this story. The newspaper clipping shown above originated with the Sunday Sport a British tabloid that publishes a mixture of softcore pornography gossip and outlandish stories such as Donkey Robs Bank and Aliens Turned Our Son Into a Fish Finger. In addition to the storys dubious source the photographs included with it were also suspect. The image purportedly showing Harry The Wolfman Harrington has been circulating online since at least 2009 and one of the mugshots purportedly showing either Garfield Morgan or Kim Gorton actually depicts a man named Michael Patrick Kelly who was arrested in 2004 for lewd conduct with a minor. The premise of this rumor was repurposed in September 2017 for a fake news article which claimed that two looters (now named James Tobbes and Michael Smith) who were sodomized after breaking into a home during Hurricane Irma.",,0,0,,

See Example( s ) EXAMPLES Collected via Collected via e-mail July 2006 It is found that mixture of honey and cinnamon cures most of the diseases. Honey is produced in most of the countries of the world. Scientists of today also accept honey as a ""Ram Ban"" (very effective) medicine for all kinds of diseases. Honey can be used without any side effects for any kind of diseases. Todays science says that even though honey is sweet if taken in the right dosage as a medicine it does not harm diabetic patients. Weekly World News a magazine in Canada in its issue dated 17 January 1995 has given the following list of diseases that can be cured by honey and cinnamon as researched by western scientists. HEART DISEASES: Make a paste of honey and cinnamon powder apply on bread chapatti or other bread instead of jelly and jam and eat it regularly for breakfast. It reduces the cholesterol in the arteries and saves the patient from heart attack. Also those who already had an attack if they do this process daily are kept miles away from the next attack. Regular use of the above process relieves loss of breath and strengthens the heart beat. In America and Canada various nursing homes have treated patients successfully and have found that as you age the arteries and veins lose their flexibility and get clogged; honey and cinnamon revitalizes the arteries and veins. BLADDER INFECTIONS: Take two tablespoons of cinnamon powder and one teaspoon of honey in a glass of lukewarm water and drink it. It destroys the germs in the bladder. TOOTHACHE: Make a paste of one teaspoon of cinnamon powder and five teaspoons of honey and apply on the aching tooth. This may be applied three times a day until the tooth stops aching. CHOLESTEROL: Two tablespoons of honey and three teaspoons of cinnamon powder mixed in 16 ounces of tea water given to a cholesterol patient was found to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood by 10% within 2 hours. As mentioned for arthritic patients if taken 3 times a day any chronic cholesterol is cured. As per information received in the said journal pure honey taken with food daily relieves complaints of cholesterol. COLDS: Those suffering from common or severe colds should take one tablespoon lukewarm honey with 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder daily for 3 days. This process will cure most chronic cough cold and clear the sinuses. UPSET STOMACH: Honey taken with cinnamon powder cures stomach ache and also clears stomach ulcers from the root. GAS: According to the studies done in India & Japan it is revealed that if honey is taken with cinnamon powder the stomach is relieved of gas. IMMUNE SYSTEM: Daily use of honey and cinnamon powder strengthens the immune system and protects the body from bacteria and viral attacks. Scientists have found that honey has various vitamins and iron in large amounts. Constant use of honey strengthens the white blood corpuscles to fight bacteria and viral diseases. INDIGESTION: Cinnamon powder sprinkled on two tablespoons of honey taken before food relieves acidity and digests the heaviest of meals. INFLUENZA: A scientist in Spain has proved that honey contains a natural ingredient which kills the influenza germs and saves the patient from flu. LONGEVITY: Tea made with honey and cinnamon powder when taken regularly arrests the ravages of old age. Take 4 teaspoons of honey 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder and 3 cups of water and boil to make like tea. Drink 1/4 cup 3 to 4 times a day. It keeps the skin fresh and soft and arrests old age. PIMPLES: Mix three tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon to make a powder paste. Apply this paste on the pimples before sleeping and wash it next morning with warm water. If done daily for two weeks it removes pimples from the root. SKIN INFECTIONS: Apply honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts on the affected parts to cure eczema ringworm and all types of skin infections. WEIGHT LOSS: Daily in the morning 1/2 hour before breakfast on an empty stomach and at night before sleeping drink honey and cinnamon powder boiled in one cup water. If taken regularly it reduces the weight of even the most obese person. Also drinking this mixture regularly does not allow the fat to accumulate in the body even though the person may eat a high calorie diet. CANCER: Recent research in Japan and Australia has revealed that advanced cancer of the stomach and bones have been cured successfully. Patients suffering from these kinds of cancer should daily take one tablespoon of honey with one teaspoon of cinnamon powder for one month 3 times a day. FATIGUE: Recent studies have shown that the sugar content of honey is more helpful rather than being detrimental to the strength of the body. Senior citizens who take honey and cinnamon power in equal parts are more alert and flexible. Dr. Milton who has done research says that a half tablespoon honey taken in a glass of water and sprinkled with cinnamon powder taken daily after brushing your teeth and in the afternoon at about 3:00 p.m. When the vitality of the body starts to decrease increases the vitality of the body within a week. BAD BREATH: People of South America first thing in the morning gargle with one teaspoon of honey and cinnamon powder mixed in hot water so their breath stays fresh throughout the day. Mixture RATING Mixture WHATS TRUE Both cinnamon and honey have properties allowing them to help with issues like skin infections toothaches or otherwise minor ailments. WHATS FALSE Neither of them can help with broad-ranging pain or other major health concerns. ORIGIN An item extolling the medicinal virtues of honey and cinnamon is based upon a 17 January 1995 article that appeared in the Weekly World News the erstwhile supermarket tabloid known for publishing the fantastically fictional (it has since transitioned to an online medium) so as a piece of medical literature it should be taken with many grains of salt. In general both cinnamon and honey have some moderate antibacterial/antiseptic properties so the use of them may help ameliorate symptoms of minor ailments such as bladder infections toothaches pimples and skin infections (if those ailments are being caused by bacteria that are sensitive to honey and/or cinnamon). However neither honey nor cinnamon provides broad-spectrum relief of pain or other symptoms and more efficacious remedies for all of these problems are readily and cheaply available. As for the more grandiose medical claims made here however theres no credible evidence that either honey or cinnamon is effective in lowering cholesterol levels and thereby heading off heart attacks. And although some studies have tenatively found that honey and cinnamon may each potentially have properties that could aid in the prevention or suppression of some types of cancer no study has documented that advanced cancer of the stomach and bones have been cured successfully through the admnistration of those two substances. Honey and cinnamon (individually and together) have long been touted in folklore and traditional medicine as possessing significant nutritional and health benefits (even though how much those supposed benefits have been borne out by modern scientific studies varies quite widely). The Encyclopedia of Healing Foods notes of cinnamon for example that: Cinnamon has a long history of use in both Eastern and Western cultures as a medicine. Some of its reported uses are in cases of arthritis asthma cancer diarrhea fever heart problems insomnia menstrual problems peptic ulcers psoriasis and spastic muscles. There are scientific studies to support some of these uses. Some of the confirmed effects of cinnamon are as a sedative for smooth muscle circulatory stimulant carminative digestant anticonvulsant diaphoretic diuretic antibiotic and antiulcerative. One recent investigation of sixty people with type 2 diabetes demonstrated that 1 to 6 grams of cinnamon taken daily for forty days reduced fasting blood glucose by 18 to 29 percent triglycerides by 23 to 30 percent LDL (bad) cholesterol by 7 to 27 percent and total cholesterol by 12 to 26 percent. In contrast there were no clear changes for the subjects who did not take the cinnamon. Cinnamons unique healing abilities come from three basic components in the essential oils found in its bark. These oils contain active components called cinnamaldehyde cinnamyl acetate and cinnamyl alcohol plus a wide range of other volatile substances. Cinnamon is often used in multicomponent Chinese herbal formulas some of which have been studied for clinical effects. For example cinnamon combined with Chinese thoroughwax (Bupleurum lactiflora) was shown to produce satisfactory results in the treatment of epilepsy. Out of 433 patients treated (most of whom were unresponsive to anticonvulsant drugs) 115 were cured and another 79 improved greatly. Improvements were noted not only by clinical symptoms but also by improvements in brain wave patterns.

ODonnell specifically targeted Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) who were both slow to say they would support the legislation. 2 million dollars to Senator Susan Collins and 2 million to Senator Jeff Flake if they vote NO. NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER [sic] RICH. DM (Direct message) me Susan. DM me Jeff. No s**t. $2 million cash each she said. so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 The tweet sparked a huge reaction online with many wondering if it would work while others applauded or lambasted ODonnell. Could this actually work? Nick (@Fiddies2) December 20 2017 Youre actually the best Rosie. Run for office please. Trevor Church (@TrevorChurchUS) December 20 2017 https://twitter.com/JaneS_ays/status/943381649777033216 Several people including conspiracy blogger Louise Mensch reminded ODonnell that its illegal to bribe government officials. Mensch suggested she fund their opponents instead. Indeed an examination of the US code shows that ODonnell clearly violated bribery laws by making the offer. The offense is punishable with a fine of up to three times the value of the bribe and/or 15 years in prison. 18 U.S. Code 201 Bribery of public officials and witnesses reads: However ODonnell was not to be deterred. I disagree. It is obvious there is a price she replied. Corker had one Collins too. Flake almost brave he crawled out backwards. $2 million to any GOP senator who votes no on KILLING AMERICANS. The senate passed the tax bill with a 51-48 vote in the early hours of Wednesday morning. However because of a procedural issue it had to be approved in the House again before President Trump could sign it into law. https://www.rt.com/usa/413782-rosie-odonnell-bribe-senators/?utm_source=browser&utm_medium=aplication_chrome&utm_campaign=chrome,CLAIM Malia Obama was arrested after being caught drinking while underage and running naked across the Harvard campus. False RATING False ORIGIN On 19 January 2018 the Americas Last Line of Defense published an article reporting that former first daughter Malia Obama had been arrested after being caught drinking while underage and running naked across the Harvard campus: Malia Obama has gotten herself into trouble yet again after a stupid Thirsty Thursday night stunt. Every week college students drink themselves into oblivion the day before the last day of classes for the week and Malia Obama who is under the legal drinking age of 21 is no different. Apparently the elder Obama daughter had a bit too much to drink and according to Harvard Campus Safety took a dare from her friends to streak across a parking lot with her boyfriend. None of this was true. This story was a fabrication that originated with Americas Last Line of Defense which is part of a network of fake news sites that spread political misinformation under the guise of proffering satire.

See Example( s ) EXAMPLES Collected via e-mail March 2014 I saw a post on FB stating that energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster have bull sperm in them. Is this true? Q: Do energy Drinks have bull sperm in it? A: Yes. Longhorn cattle company tested some of the top energy drinks drink brands (monster red bull etc) and found in fact they do contain bull sperm. False RATING False ORIGIN Energy drinks such as Red Bull have long been dogged by rumors that they contain dangerous ingredients such as artificially manufactured stimulants and in more recent years such rumors have taken a turn towards the bizarre with claims that various brands of energy drink include bull semen or bull sperm. More outlandish versions of such rumors maintain that some entity such as the Longhorn Cattle Company performed tests on energy drinks and found in fact they do contain bull sperm. (Why a livestock company would want to test commercial beverages for the presence of bull sperm remains unexplained.) The bull sperm rumor seems to stem from the fact that the Red Bull brand of energy drink includes taurine an organic acid which among other uses is often added to infant milk formulas (because taurine is naturally present in breast milk). The composition of that substances name taur being a Greek/Latin root for bull and the -ine suffix denoting something derived from the preceding root suggests to the casual observer that taurine is something made or excreted by a bull possibly something like bull urine. And of course the brand name Red Bull ties the product to the image of a bull and connotations of the strong powerful potent life force that animal represents so it doesnt seem like such a stretch that the drink might contain some type of vital essence taken from the animal itself. Although taurine is so named because it was first isolated from ox bile it is actually found in the large intestines and tissues of many different animals including humans. But the taurine used in Red Bull brand energy drink (and other foods) is not derived from bulls (or any other animal) at all: its synthetically produced in laboratories. Since at least 2010 Red Bulls online FAQ has addressed questions about the taurine used in their popular energy drink being made from bulls testicles or derived from bull semen: Q: IS TAURINE MADE FROM BULLS TESTICLES? IS TAURINE A DERIVATIVE OF BULLS TESTICLES OR SEMEN? A: The taurine in Red Bull Energy Drink is a purely synthetic substance produced by pharmaceutical companies and is not derived from animals or animal materials. All ingredients for Red Bull Energy Drink are synthetically produced by pharmaceutical companies. This guarantees the highest quality.

False RATING False ORIGIN In early 2018 far right web sites turned their attention to a years-old episode of a long-running German soap opera claiming that a conversation about Islam between a fictional woman and her son was evidence that the government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel was using propaganda to persuade Germans to convert to Islam or accept Islam within German society. The show caused a quite a stir in those circles. Germany is brainwashing children to become Muslim for more than a decade read a headline of one such article on the Voice of Europe web site. German state TV is working to prepare the German people for their future wrote Robert Spencer for Jihad Watch. The Vlad Tepes blog wondered aloud whether the scene constituted brutal German state propaganda to encourage children to be Muslims. Paul Joseph Watson editor-at-large for the conspiracy theorist web site Infowars incorrectly placed the soap opera episode as taking place after Germanys 2017 federal elections in a YouTube video. And on 12 January 2018 the right-wing German web site Politikstube sparked the wave of interest in the video clip writing: Unbelievable what force-fed television brings about: From today on we call God Allah. It was immediately picked up and augmented with heavily charged and offensive commentary by Politikstube. The subtitles in this video are accurate apart from the offensive translation of the Shahada (the declaration of Muslim faith) which is recited in Arabic and means There is no God but God. Mohammed is the messenger of God: The source of all this concern is a scene from Episode 1084 of the highly popular and long-running weekly soap opera Lindenstrasse which is broadcast by Germanys main publicly owned television channel Das Erste roughly equivalent to the UKs BBC One channel. In the episode entitled Islam Lisa Hoffmeister is engaged to be married to her Turkish fianc Murat Dagdelen who is a secular moderate Muslim. Convinced that she must convert to Islam in order to be accepted by Murats family Lisa has done some research and sits down to explain what she understands to be the nature of Islam and conversion to her son whom she had during a previous relationship. During the scene Lisa performs the Shahada and encourages her son to pray to Allah and follow his rules. We discussed the episode with Michael Meisheit a screenwriter and novelist who wrote for Lindenstrasse for 20 years and who scripted the episode in question. Speaking to us by Skype from his home in Berlin Meisheit told us that Lisa has a long history of really problematic issues in the show. As a child she was abused and neglected spent time in an orphanage and once even killed someone in self-defense. Though not a villain she is in the writers words the girl whos always doing strange stuff and doesnt have a firm grasp on social boundaries. Along the way she meets Murat Dagdelen a Turkish man who is the first character to truly love and accept her. In response Lisa becomes over-engaged in trying to fit in with Murat and his family who are Muslim albeit to varying degrees of devoutness. Meisheit told us that Murat is not a particularly committed Muslim but Lisa is convinced that before marrying him she herself must become a Muslim in order to fit in with his family. In Episode 1084 Lisa suggests to Murat that she accompany him to the mosque which he himself does not regularly attend. Confused Murat tells Lisa But youre not even Muslim. Thats all that is needed to trigger that kind of character Meisheit says. Why am I not a Muslim? How hard can that be? Then she looks it up on the internet and the result is that scene [the conversation with her son.] In response to Lisas zealousness those around her (including Murat and his family) tell her to take it slow and ease off in her conversion to Islam. If you criticize this scene alone Meisheit says youre taking it very much out of context. You could very well say the opposite about that scene. So rather than being propaganda designed to brainwash German children and adults to convert to Islam the subplot of Lisas conversion to Islam and the scene showing her conversation with her son were deliberately written to show someone with a history of personal problems overdoing her conversion to Islam in an unnecessary and somewhat desperate effort to fit in with her fiancs family who love her anyway. Meisheit says he deliberately wrote the scene to show she is overreacting for personal reasons not religious reasons and that this behavior is very typical for that character. In later episodes Lisa takes to wearing a Muslim headscarf but ultimately relents in her zealousness after Murats aunt who is a secular Muslim like Murat himself takes her aside and tells her that her efforts are appreciated but unnecessary and that Murats family loves and accepts her as she is. When the episode first aired in Germany in 2006 there was no public outcry or negative reaction Meisheit told us. As the person who wrote the episode and the scene involving Lisas son he says he finds the uproar a full twelve years later to be bizarre knowing what the scene really was. He added: For me its a textbook example of taking something out of context. The accusation of brainwashing by the German state is also unfounded in a second important way. Lindenstrasse is shot and produced in Cologne by Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WRD) one of several regional public television channels that form the ARD consortium which broadcasts content on a national level on Das Erste Germanys biggest publicly-owned national television channel. So it is true to say that Lindenstrasse is both made and shown by a public broadcaster. However the German federal government does not control the content of the show. This was confirmed to us by WDRs Goetz Schmedes the commissioning editor of Lindenstrasse. The characters plots and story arcs are all created by the shows writers and producers Meisheit told us. When he wrote Episode 1084 including the conversation between Lisa and her son he did so without interference from executives at WRD or ARD or from the German government. Nobody told me to do that he said. The claim that the scene constitutes pro-Islam propaganda on the part of the German government is false on two grounds. Firstly because the scene was deliberately written to demonstrate a characters troubling overzealousness in matters of the heart something that critics at Jihad Watch Voice of Europe and elsewhere failed to grasp. Secondly it is false because the German government does not have that kind of power or influence over the content of a soap opera even one on a publicly-owned television channel.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN The so-called Tide Pod Challenge a bizarre viral social media phenomenon involving teens sharing videos of themselves consuming liquid laundry detergent pods crossed over into fake news territory in mid-January 2018 with the publication of an article stating that members of the Marine Corps have taken up the fad. An 18 January post on the satirical Duffel Blog said that the Corps top leaders had issued a warning to junior troops to stop eating the pods after an unspecified number were hospitalized as a result of doing so: WASHINGTON The Marine Corps top leaders have warned junior troops to stop eating Tide Pods after a number of Marines have been hospitalized due to poisoning sources confirmed today. I dont care what you guys do. Hell you can even go back to drunken driving. Just stop eating laundry detergent for Christs sake said Gen. Robert Neller the Marine Commandant. Top officials have expressed concern in recent days over a number of incidents involving enlisted troops taking part in the Tide Pod Challenge a viral internet campaign that challenges people to put laundry detergent in their mouth in order to raise awareness for Charles Darwin. While we do not doubt that youthful military personnel are as susceptible as anyone else to idiotic fads weve found no reports in reliable news sources of U.S. troops hospitalized for laundry detergent poisoning.

The State Attorneys Division of Integrity in Elections is calling the acts of the women a blatant disregard for the duties of civil servants a violation of the public trust and a 2nd-degree felony. Wanda Werkmeister Olivia Pertuiary and Maureen Brown will all face charges of conspiracy to contribute to widespread voter fraud and violation of the public trust both punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a million dollars in fines. Roy Moores campaign on the news that voter fraud was rampant in Birmingham and all of Applevale County is standing by at the door of the clerks office to the 17th District Federal Court of Appeals to file an injunction against a single vote from the Democrat stronghold to be counted. Pundits on both sides are speculating that the outcome will almost certainly be a Roy Moore win. Sean Hannity speaking as a guest on Dana Loeschs new show Guns God and Grits said: WITHOUT THAT INNER-CITY GHETTO VOTE DOUG JONES DOESNT HAVE A CHANCE. IT DOESNT MAKE MUCH SENSE WHY SOMEONE FROM THE CITYS VOTE IS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO DEMOCRATS WHO SWEAR THEY ARENT AT ALL RACIST. The Alabama Office of Election Certification and Ethics says it will abide by the wishes of the Secretary of State before certifying the vote and sending it to the governor for his signature. Big League Politics Judge Roy Moore is calling for all the votes to be counted in the Alabama Senate election refusing to concede the race to Doug Jones even as the mainstream media declares a premature victory. Moore is down 1.7 points and only needs to come within a half-point to spark a statewide recount. Absentee ballots from military service members have still not been counted. Mobile County a heavily pro-Jones county tabulated its votes later than the pro-Moore counties and eventually gave Jones the lead. The Alabama Supreme Court shot down a lower court ruling Tuesday requiring counties to preserve their digital voting records. Thus the Supreme Court is allowing counties to destroy their voter records. The Moore legal team will need to jump on this development fast to protect those records. Evidence of voter fraud exists in the election. Democratic activists made a last-minute push to get out the vote against Roy Moore in Alabama by encouraging African-Americans in Mississippi to vote in the wrong state. Sources on the ground in Alabama confirm that these tactics are real and they have been used by supporters of Democrat Doug Jones. Big League Politics received evidence of a Reddit call for African-Americans in Mississippi to make a short trip to Alabama on December 12. That Reddit thread is still active. Similar calls have been made on Reddit for African-Americans in other nearby states including Georgia and Tennessee.

Articles Source .,CLAIM Criminals are furtively wedging coins into car door handles in order to more easily break into vehicles. See Example( s ) EXAMPLES Collected via e-mail January 2016 Before you get in your car on the way to work youre going to need to check your door very carefully. Theres a new trend among thieves that can easily be missed. Thieves are becoming more brazen and are now using a very sneaky and easy-to-miss method of breaking into your car. Check your door as they may shove a quarter or penny into the gap like this. If you miss it in the morning and drive away nothing really happens. The kicker is when you come home at night. When you get home and press the lock button on your remote the system will fail to lock. Then when you go inside the waiting thief walks right up to your door and opens it. To be safe before getting in your car CHECK THE DOORS! Please pass on this message to your friends and family so they know what to look for. Stay safe out there. Posted from qpolitical.com on FacebookSome reports claim the thieves sometimes hide in the back of your car ready to attack you when you get inside. So PLEASE before getting into your car make sure to check door handles and your back seat! PLEASE STAY SAFE and share this with those you care about!!! False RATING False ORIGIN Starting at the end of 2015 social media rumors circulated warning about a purported new way for thieves to thieve: criminals simply needed to wedge a coin in the car handle of any vehicle in order to seamlessly override the cars locking mechanism without attracting the drivers attention. As the iteration above illustrated this supposedly helpful crime-avoidance tip was aimed solely at owners of newer vehicles with remote locking systems. (Those with manual locking mechanisms were apparently exempt from the warnings as warnings specifically cited motorists using remote locking systems as being at risk for automobile-related perfidy.) A common version of the warning held that the vehicle break-in ploy was increasing in frequency of occurrence: Car thieves are always trying to find new schemes for getting into your car to steal your valuables. You may have heard reports of tech devices used to enter your car. But some thieves are using a less intricate method. There have been a rash of robberies using of all things a penny or nickel! How are they using a coin to enter your car? Whether your car is sitting in your driveway or a lot when you are shopping the thief slides a nickel or penny in the door handle of the passenger side. To what end? Another version described a long-con method of breaking in to vehicles requiring thieves to set a trap and return hours later (or take the risk of following their mark to a destination on the off-chance the car might have money or valuables in it): If you miss [seeing the coin] in the morning and drive away nothing really happens. The kicker is when you come home at night. We contacted Caliber Collision Repair in Lindenhurst New York to ask whether a maneuver like the one described in the warnings would effectively disable any vehicles locking mechanism. When we described the rumor the employee laughed and explained that car door locks cant really be disabled in that fashion. He said that on most current vehicle models there is no place in which to wedge a coin and that even on models with inadvertent coin slots the key fob locking mechanism wouldnt be disrupted by the depicted coin-wedging. We also spoke with the service department at Arnold Chevrolet Buick in Babylon New York where a mechanic also laughed and described the claim as highly implausible. He surmised that on some older vehicles it might be possible to sabotage a lock with a coin but those vehicles were unlikely to feature remote locking systems. And were late model vehicles to be sabotaged in such a fashion their drivers would notice when manually engaging the locks. Most social media users commenting on such warnings also affirmed that their cars didnt have spots on their doors wherein coins could be lodged and noted that their keyfobs wouldnt work properly if all doors werent closed securely. Others observed that when they attempted to reproduce the claim they discovered that the wedged coins didnt disrupt the vehicles locking mechanisms at all. Also despite the warnings claim that employment of this method of theft has created rash of robberies we were unable to turn up a single documented incidence of a car being broken into in this fashion. As one of the examples excerpted above demonstrates some variants of the car door handle warning invoke the classic urban legend about a killer in the back seat.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN False rumors about McDonalds restaurants using worms as filler in their hamburgers and true reports of some retail chains being vended food products tainted with horse meat due to problems with supplies have been the basis for wild (but apparently believable) claims that an Oklahoma City McDonalds outlet was caught with horse meat and human meat in their freezers. Such claims originated with a 27 March 2014 article published by the Huzlers web site: First Horse meat then the mysterious Pink slime Now Human meat? A shocking discovery has been made in an Oklahoma City McDonalds meat factory and other McDonalds meat factories nationwide. Meat inspectors reportedly found what appeared to be Human meat stored in the meat factory freezers of an Oklahoma City meat factory and human meat already in trucks right outside the factory ready to be shipped to McDonalds restaurants. Health inspectors immediately demanded inspection in various McDonalds meat factories across the country and horrifyingly found human meat in about 90% of the factories inspected thus far. The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) has seized McDonalds production and shipping and will call for more meat factory inspections and restaurant inspections. The FBI is also investigating the factories. FBI agent Lloyd Harrison told Huzler reporters The worst part is that its not only human meat its child meat. the body parts that were found across the U.S. factories were deemed to small to be adult body parts this is truly horrible. The situation brings up many unanswered questions. How long have they been using human meat? Where did they get the children from? Were they already dead when brought into factories? Investigators and Inspectors are currently being deployed for intensive investigations all around the U.S. However that McDonalds article was just a spoof from the Huzlers web site which offers users the ability to Create your own news prank and trick your friends by sharing it and has a history of publishing fabricated news stories (such as one about pop star Justin Biebers admitting to being bisexual and one about the 2014 Super Bowl being rigged).

False RATING False ORIGIN As a war of words heated up between President Trump and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) over the release of a controversial memo attempting to discredit the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election a rumor popped up on internet forums that Schiffs sister was married to the son of philanthropist George Soros. Schiff who is the ranking minority member of the House Intelligence Committee wrote a rebuttal to Devin Nuness memo alleging that the FBI had improperly obtained a warrant to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Soon after users on forums like 4chan Above Top Secret and Free Republic began posting the rumor that Schiff was related to Soros by marriage. The rumor then spread to fake news sites. The conspiracy-minded TruthFeed reported that Twitter is on fire with the revelation that Democratic party mouthpiece Adam Schiff turns out to have family ties to none other than George Soros himself and posted a series of tweets about the alleged connection. The article used a series of images of tweets: These rumors also inspired the creation of at least one meme: A disingenuous fact check from the partisan Tempest Times also lent some unearned credence to this rumor. A woman named Melissa Robin Schiff did indeed marry Robert Soros the son of George Soros in 1992. However she is not Congressman Schiffs sister. The wedding announcement published in the New York Times in 1992 identified Melissa Schiffs parents as Marlene and Haskel. As of September 2017 the two were in the midst of a messy divorce. Adam Schiff on the other hand was born to Sherry and Ed Schiff. The California congressman also has a brother named Daniel. Schiff does not have a sister his spokesperson confirmed to us by email. His spokesperson also told us that he has no family relationship at all to Melissa Schiff. To some the name George Soros invokes the idea of a shadowy Illuminati-like group pulling the strings behind a series of conspiracies. In recent years hes been falsely accused of paying Black Lives Matter groups to riot of orchestrating a false flag in Charlottesville and of bankrolling women to falsely accuse former Senate Candidate Roy Moore of sexual assault. To these people merely being associated with Soros is enough to totally destroy a persons credibility. So when Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) was thrust into the political limelight in February 2018 it wasnt too surprising to see the billionaire investors name get tossed once again into the rumor mill. This isnt the first time that this smear-by-association tactic has been used. During the 2016 election for instance actor Scott Baio popularized an old (and false) rumor that Chelsea Clinton was married to Soross nephew.,,0,0,,

The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for the last two years insisting she needed breast implants and begging for a surgery. Her mother Dana Manson says she tried to convince Juliet that her breasts would grow with time but her daughter was completely obsessed with the idea of getting breast implants. She would ask us multiple times a day every day she told NBC. There was nothing in the world that she wanted more than having boobs. Ms Manson even consulted a psychiatrist with her daughter hoping to rid Juliet of her obsession. The result however was very different from what she expected. After a dozen sessions with young girl the renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez concluded that she was suffering from a severe depression and had a serious lack of self-esteem and told her mother that a surgery could be beneficial. Doctor Ramirez says the young girl has developed some serious complexes about her appearance over the years and the operation will help her get an improved image of herself. Following the psychiatrists advice Ms Manson contacted dozens on clinics in the United States and Mexico but none of them were willing to perform a breast augmentation surgery on such a young girl. She finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China where doctors were willing to perform the operation. Dana Manson decided that she would go on the trip to Asia with her daughter over the holidays and that the surgery would count as her Christmas present. They left for China on December 22 and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned. The young girl now has a 30C cup and her mother says shes extremely happy about her about her new breasts. Dana Manson told NBC that like every mother in the world she wanted her children to be happy and that Juliet was clearly unhappy about not having any breasts. The young girls story caught the worlds attention after she posted several pictures of herself on her Instagram account only hours after the surgery instantly causing a storm of reactions on the social media. Many people are denouncing the Manson parents for allowing their daughter to undergo plastic surgery at such a young age while others are blaming her psychiatrist for his recommendation. Despite the critics Dana Manson says she did what was best for her daughter and insists that she has no regrets.,"CLAIM Actor Denzel Washington said electing President Trump saved the U.S. from becoming an ""Orwellian police state.""

Latifah Brown called 911 around 9:30 PM last night reporting that she had a baby stuck in her vagina. The operator first assumed that she was giving birth at home and dispatched an ambulance to the site. The paramedics had quite a surprise when they arrived on the site and saw what was actually happening. One of the paramedics Brian Whitmore related the incident in an interview with WBNS-10 TV. The little boy wore a diaper and pyjamas but he had his legs and abdomen stuck in the womans vagina. The paramedics spent more than an hour on the site trying to release the child from his difficult position but were unable to get the toddler out. I dont know how she got the child in there! We were both pulling as strong as we could and he wouldnt come out. Ms. Brown and the child were finally transported to the hospital where doctors were able to separate them after a delicate operation. The young boy suffers from a dislocated hip but doctors dont think he will suffer any sequelae from the incident. The babysitter was interrogated by police and confessed to deliberately inserting the child in her vaginal cavity. She explained that she was feeling depressed after her doctor told her she could never have children and wanted to know how it felt to give birth. Ms. Brown now faces a total of 11 criminal charges including aggravated child neglect causing bodily harm and could spend up to 65 years in prison. Her lawyer has asked for a psychiatric evaluation claiming that she isnt fit to stand trial. Depending on the results of the evaluation her trial could begin in June.,CLAIM The FDA has ruled that homeopathic drugs are now illegal. False RATING False ORIGIN On 30 January 2018 Joseph Mercola the doctor behind the pseudoscientific alternative health and supplement empire Mercola.com published a story with a factually incorrect claim characteristic of the sites dubious commitment to accuracy: FDA Declares Homeopathic Drugs Illegal Plans to Ramp Up Enforcement Actions The document cited in support of this claim is a December 2017 draft of an FDA guidance statement that a.) changes no laws and creates or alters no existing regulations; and b.) is still in the public review stage and therefore not even a finalized form of a non-legally binding document. That document contains this disclaimer: This draft guidance when finalized will represent the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. FDA guidance documents as described by federal law are documents that have been prepared for FDA staff applicants/sponsors and the public that describe the agencys interpretation of or policy on a regulatory issue. True to form this draft proposes an updated interpretation of the the agencys handling of over the counter products branded as homeopathic a specific alternative health modality that relies on discredited 18th century pseudoscience requiring among other things a belief in the scientifically baseless concept that water retains a memory of chemicals it no longer contains: Under U.S. law homeopathic drugs are required to meet the same approval rules as other drugs. But under a policy adopted in 1988 the agency has used enforcement discretion to allow the items to be manufactured and distributed without FDA approval. Agency officials dont plan to begin requiring that homeopathic products get approval officials say that would be impractical but they are signaling stepped-up scrutiny for items deemed a possible health threat. [] Under its planned approach many products wont be considered high risk and will remain available to consumers Janet Woodcock director of the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research told reporters during a teleconference. But she said the agency would go after products that cause or might cause overt harm. Since 1988 it has been the de facto policy of the FDA to treat homeopathic remedies listed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (a collection of homeopathic ingredients and practices continually updated since 1897) as safe and legal to market so long as that marketing does not meet the FDAs definition of making fraudulent claims. In March 2015 the FDA proposed a re-evaluation of its regulatory approach to over-the-counter homeopathic remedies in light of the fact that the industry and the products and ingredients it promotes have greatly expanded since 1988. The draft guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration in December 2017 is a result of those 2015 discussions and it would serve primarily as a notice to those marketing homeopathic products that the informal policy of treating homeopathic remedies as exempt from new drug regulations an expensive process requiring a scientific study of the safety and efficacy of a product will not apply necessarily apply to homeopathic products that may present a risk to public health. Since no homeopathic remedies have gone through any new drug approval process any homeopathic remedy would theoretically be susceptible to this higher bar of scrutiny. However as stated in their draft guidance document the Food and Drug Administration has always had this authority and this therefore represents no legal change in regulation: Nothing in the [United States Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FD&C] exempts drugs labeled as homeopathic from any of the requirements related to approval adulteration and misbranding including labeling requirements. If a drug labeled as homeopathic is a new drug under the FD&C Act it is subject to the same premarket approval requirements and the same standards for safety and efficacy as all new drugs. Because reassessing the entire pharmacopoeia of homeopathic remedies is not plausible or feasible the agency has said that it will focus its attention on those products that fall into one of six high risk categories: Products with reported safety concerns. Products that contain or purport to contain ingredients associated with potentially significant safety concerns. Products for routes of administration other than oral and topical. Products intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of serious and/or life163 threatening diseases and conditions. Products for vulnerable populations (i.e. immunocompromised individuals infants and children the elderly and pregnant women) Products deemed adulterated (i.e. the chemicals in the product do not match what is claimed to be in the product) This interpretation of existing law would not have any effect on a vast majority of homeopathic products currently available in the United States making Mercolas headline claim (All Homeopathic Products Now Illegal?) false. Homeopathy should not be confused with other alternative holistic or natural remedies. It refers specifically to a scientifically discredited practice invented in 1796 which was and is based on the belief that chemicals that cause symptoms in healthy people can in an absurdly diluted form cure sick individuals of those same symptoms. Proponents of the practice claim that the more dilute the chemical the more powerful its healing abilities making it statistically likely that many homeopathic preparations are so diluted that they contain not a single atom of the chemical in question. This is not an issue for proponents of the practice because according to its guiding theories water remembers what was in it. In an effort to suggest that the medical experts are opposed to regulation of homeopathy and to conflate homeopathy with other alternative health practices to generate maximum outrage and thus clicking and sharing potential Mercola cites quotes given by Dr. Lee Hieb the director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons to a fringe conspiracy web site: Im not here to tout any particular over-the-counter remedy but who gave the FDA total ability to limit what we can take into our bodies while virtually forcing us to be given what they prescribe? Its none of their business whether a homeopathic remedy is worthless. Thats an issue of commerce and truth in advertising. I for one want the freedom to research and decide for myself what supplements to take even if my supplements ultimately do me no good. The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons is a far-right political (not medical) organization that in no way represents any consensus view of medical professionals in the United States. Their official publications have espoused pseudoscientific claims including the notion that being gay reduces life expectancy that HIV does not cause AIDS that there is a link between abortion and breast cancer and that there is a proven causal connection between autism and vaccines. In terms of homeopathy being an issue of truth in advertising the United States Federal Trade Commission agrees. In 2016 the FTC issued a new policy regarding the marketing and promotion of over-the-counter homeopathic remedies stating that such products would be deemed deceptively advertised if they did not include language indicating that there is no scientific proof that homeopathy works. Because the FDA document cited by Mercola represents no change in law however we rank the claim that the FDA has recently deemed all of them illegal as false.,,0,0,,

Tom and Janis Morrison a young couple from the small town of Greensboro in Alabama called 911 around 10:00 pm last night to ask for an ambulance. Samantha Irving the operator who took the call says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation. The woman told me that her husband had fallen and that his head was now stuck in her vaginal cavity. I really thought that it was a group of teenagers making a prank call. Despite Ms. Irvings doubts she sent an ambulance on the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious. Bill Austin one of the paramedics who transported the couple claims they were lying naked on their bed and partially covered in blood. The woman kept screaming out in pain whenever the guy moved but he had half of his face buried in there and he looked like he was going through Hell! The couple was transported to the nearby Hale County Hospital where doctors were able to separate the couple. Ms. Morrison suffered from severe internal bleeding but is now stable while her husband has suffered only a few scratches and bruises. According to doctors both could also suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome. Incidents like this one are indeed quite unusual but hundreds of couples are admitted to the hospital every year in the U.S. after getting stuck together during sexual intercourse. According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 3213 couples were hospitalized for such problems across the country in 2015 and 3789 in 2016. According to the same data the Morrisons are the first couple to be hospitalized for a head stuck inside a vaginal cavity since October 2007.,CLAIM Sargento cheese was recalled on 9 May 2017 (or in August/September 2017) because it might kill your whole family. Outdated RATING WHATS TRUE Fourteen varieties of the brand were recalled in February 2017 a warning inaccurately resurrected with a clickbait title several months later. WHATS FALSE Sargento cheese was not recalled in May August or September 2017 or in 2018. ORIGIN On 9 May 2017 a large number of Facebook users shared an alarming link about Sargento (Americas Most Popular Cheese) harboring bacteria with the potential to kill your family: America Flash News reported that in early May 2017 Sargento cheeses were part of a massive recall: Its time to check your fridges. Sargento Foods Inc. has just issued a massive recall of seven cheeses due to a potential contamination from listeria monocytogenes. The company confirms no illnesses have been reported yet. Listeriosis is a serious infection contracted by eating food contaminated with bacteria. An estimated 1600 people get infected each yearand about 260 die. The bacteria is most harmful to pregnant women newborns adults aged 65 or older and people with weakened immune systems. Sargento is continuing to closely monitor and gather information from their supplier based in Middlebury Ind. The supplier reportedly notified Sargento Food Inc. that a specialty Longhorn Colby cheese it supplied had potentially been contaminated and needed to be recalled. A date of 9 May 2017 was clearly visible on the report and on Sargentos Facebook page concerned users asked about circulating recall rumors. The brands Facebook team responded to one such comment: Hi Brooke Select products were recalled in February. If you have recently purchased Sargento cheese it isnt affected by the recall. To see a full list of recalled products you can visit info.sargento.com and search by UPC or sell-by date. Both UPC and sell-by date must match for your product to be affected. A 10 February 2017 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recall notice announced what was then a current recall but it was not in effect in May 2017: Deutsch Kase Haus LLC of Middlebury Ind. has notified Sargento Foods Inc. that a specialty Longhorn Colby cheese they supplied to Sargento must be recalled due to a potential contamination of Listeria monocytogenes. No illnesses have been reported. The affected retail products are Sargento Ultra Thin Sliced Longhorn Colby 6.84 oz. UPC 4610000228 with Sell By dates of 12APR17B and 10MAY17B and Sargento Chef Blends Shredded Nacho & Taco Cheese 8 oz. UPC 4610040041 with Sell By dates of H14JUN17 and H12JUL17. These products were packaged at the Sargento Plymouth Wis. facility. Sargentos web site reiterates that the recall occurred in February 2017 not three months later. In May 2017 representatives for the brand clarified that no recall is currently in effect and it is unclear why the information recirculated as if it was new. The zombie recall warning is far from the first of its kind as a similar web site caused a February 2017 scare by resurrecting outdated news of a baby wipes recall. In August and September 2017 multiple items with titles such as Breaking: Americas Most Popular Cheese Recalled Immediately Throw It Away This Can Kill Your Family circulated on Facebook about the same outdated recall.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 30 January 2018 President Trump delivered his first State of the Union address eliciting both praise and criticism including a written response from Faiz Shakir of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) condemning Trumps speech as exclusionary and divisive. In a classic case of either missing or purposely misrepresenting the point (its hard to tell which) the right-wing web site CNS News published an article (and other sites with a similar slant reposted it) declaring that the ACLU had complained that Trump repeated the word America more than 80 times during his address: The American Civil Liberties Union note the word American in its title complained Tuesday night about President Trumps repeated use of the word America in his State of the Union speech. In a written response to Trumps speech Faiz Shakir the ACLUs national political director said: Tonight President Trump said the word America more than 80 times in his speech. Yet after a divisive first year we hear and feel how exclusionary that America is with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities. The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities both in the courts and at the polls. In particular the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force. We are at this crossroads because of the Presidents deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric. We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let Americas Dreamers be deported. We too counted more than 80 instances of America (including variants such as American or Americans) in a transcript of the address but thats neither here nor there. Were not shocked or dismayed and we can only assume the political director of the ACLU wasnt shocked or dismayed that a presidential address would contain so many references to America and Americans. The shocker rather is that CNS News had the temerity to open their article with a statement directly contradicted by the quote that followed in which Shakir clearly did not complain about Trumps repeated use of the word America. On the contrary he criticized Trump for advocating immigration policies that in his view go against everything America stands for.",,0,0,,

The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for the last two years insisting she needed breast implants and begging for a surgery. Her mother Dana Manson says she tried to convince Juliet that her breasts would grow with time but her daughter was completely obsessed with the idea of getting breast implants. She would ask us multiple times a day every day she told NBC. There was nothing in the world that she wanted more than having boobs. Ms Manson even consulted a psychiatrist with her daughter hoping to rid Juliet of her obsession. The result however was very different from what she expected. After a dozen sessions with young girl the renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez concluded that she was suffering from a severe depression and had a serious lack of self-esteem and told her mother that a surgery could be beneficial. Doctor Ramirez says the young girl has developed some serious complexes about her appearance over the years and the operation will help her get an improved image of herself. Following the psychiatrists advice Ms Manson contacted dozens on clinics in the United States and Mexico but none of them were willing to perform a breast augmentation surgery on such a young girl. She finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China where doctors were willing to perform the operation. Dana Manson decided that she would go on the trip to Asia with her daughter over the holidays and that the surgery would count as her Christmas present. They left for China on December 22 and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned. The young girl now has a 30C cup and her mother says shes extremely happy about her about her new breasts. Dana Manson told NBC that like every mother in the world she wanted her children to be happy and that Juliet was clearly unhappy about not having any breasts. The young girls story caught the worlds attention after she posted several pictures of herself on her Instagram account only hours after the surgery instantly causing a storm of reactions on the social media. Many people are denouncing the Manson parents for allowing their daughter to undergo plastic surgery at such a young age while others are blaming her psychiatrist for his recommendation. Despite the critics Dana Manson says she did what was best for her daughter and insists that she has no regrets.,CLAIM President Trump ordered the execution of several turkeys pardoned by President Obama.

( Continue reading...,"CLAIM U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley ""accidentally confessed`-to being romantically involved with President Trump. False RATING False ORIGIN In January 2018 Michael Wolff the author of the controversial political tell-all book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House maintained that President Trump was currently involved in an extramarital affair and that although he didnt have the ultimate proof to incorporate that claim into his book an oblique reference to the subject could nevertheless be found by those who read between the lines toward the end of the book. Pundits quickly identified the passage presumably referenced by Wolff as one that named Nikki Haley the former South Carolina governor whom President Trump appointed as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations: By October however many of the presidents staff took particular notice of one of the few remaining Trump opportunists: Nikki Haley the UN ambassador. Haley as ambitious as Lucifer in the characterization of one member of the senior staff had concluded that Trumps tenure would last at best a single term and that she with the requisite submission could be his heir apparent. The president has been spending a notable amount of private time with Haley on Air Force One and was seen to be grooming her for a national political future. Haley who was much more of a traditional Republican one with a pronounced moderate streak a type increasingly known as a Jarvanka Republican was evident to many being mentored in Trumpian ways. The danger here offered one senior Trumper is that she is so much smarter than him. In response Ambassador Haley (who had been the subject of similar extramarital affair rumors while a gubernatorial candidate in 2010) vehemently denied any personal involvement with President Trump during an appearance on Politicos Women Rule podcast: Nikki Haley became a trusted member of Donald Trumps inner circle over the past year but shes recently refamiliarized herself with a downside of professional success: rumors of an affair this time with the president of the United States. Trumps ambassador to the United Nations calls the chatter highly offensive and disgusting the result of what happens far too often to strong women. It is absolutely not true Haley said arguing that Wolff not only has his facts wrong but that his insinuation is similar to other attacks that she and other successful women have faced when theyve been forced to swat down suggestions theyve slept their way to the top. I have literally been on Air Force One once and there were several people in the room when I was there she said in an interview for POLITICOs Women Rule podcast referring to a flight from Washington to Long Island in late July [2017]. He says that Ive been talking a lot with the president in the Oval about my political future. Ive never talked once to the president about my future and I am never alone with him. Nonetheless multiple political web sites (mostly of the clickbait variety) ran pieces headlined Nikki Haley Just ACCIDENTALLY Confessed to Being Romantically Involved with Trump! even though the text of the underlying articles didnt describe Haley confessing to any such thing inadvertently or otherwise: Those articles merely reported the same thing as the one youre reading now: that Wolff had insinuated an affair between Haley and Trump and that Haley had strenuously denied it during a recent interview with Politico. No matter how much between-the-line reading one might engage in nothing the U.N. ambassador said during that Politico interview (or elsewhere) could be remotely construed as her affirming that she was or had ever been romantically involved with Donald Trump.",,0,0,,

Canadian law allowed for the assisted medical suicide for terminally ill or suffering adults who could legally volunteer to end their own life.This law wasnt extended to children as its felt that a minor wouldnt be able to consent to their own death. Now the new legislation will pass the responsibility of consensual death over to the parents allowing them to decide whether to euthanize their child.The change was prompted by a survey by the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) that showed an overwhelming demand from parents for euthanizing children.Wesley Smith an American anti-euthanasia activist said the shift in legislation proves the morally slippery slope that a nation slides down when it decides that killing is an acceptable answer to human suffering. Writing in the National Review he said: Once euthanasia consciousness is unleashed it never stops expandingI guess Robert Latimera Canadian farmer who murdered his daughter because she had cerebral palsywas a visionary. According to LSN The CPS surveyed its members in light of the possibility Canada will expand euthanasia to children.Indeed Justin Trudeaus Liberal government had already written that possibility into the law it passed in June 2016. Bill C-14 permits voluntary euthanasia for individuals of at least 18 years of age assessed to be suffering intolerably from a grievous and irremediable medical condition and with natural death reasonably foreseeable. But the Commons Justice Committee added an amendment to the bill directing the federal government to review expanding euthanasia on three further grounds: for children or mature minors; solely for mental illness; and allowing advance directives in the case of those with degenerative diseases such as dementia. The Liberals requested the Council of Canadian Academics to review the amendments before they were quickly ushered through ParliamentThe CPS surveyed 1050 pediatricians on their experiences with medical aid in dying or MAID and released a report at the end of October.Forty-five doctors reported receiving explicit requests from parents to euthanize 91 children it said. More than half of these requests were for neonates or infants under a year old.A further 118 pediatricians had exploratory discussions about euthanasia with parents of 419 children.As for requests from the children themselves 35 paediatricians reported discussing euthanasia with 60 minors.Nine reported receiving direct requests for euthanasia from 17 minors. While such consultations may be rare minors in Canada are contemplating MAID-related concepts and approaching health care providers with MAID-related questions noted the CPS survey. Given the evolving legislative landscape it is reasonable to anticipate that such questions will increase in the near future. The CPS also conducted an attitude survey on euthanasia with 574 of a possible 1979 members or 29 percent responding.Of these 46 percent supported euthanizing mature minors who have progressive or terminal illness or intractable pain. Thirty-three percent opposed euthanizing mature minors for any reason. Mature minors are children who are allegedly capable of understanding the nature and consequences of treatment and so judged competent to request death by lethal injection.The CPS study suggested non-voluntary euthanasia for non-competent dying and/or severely disabled children is acceptable. Canadas federal law and Quebecs law previously prohibited involuntary euthanasia for anyone it said adding: However given the human rights framework advanced in Carter v. Canada the parents of a dying and/or severely disabled child who is deemed to be suffering may in the near future be looking to the courts to support a right to end their childs life. Decision-making for treatment of never-competent children is based on the best interest standard: choosing among options that reasonable persons acting in good faith on anothers behalf would consider acceptable in similar circumstances. All this is very problematic says Alex Schadenberg executive director of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition.Euthanasia lobbyists shift the argument for legalizing the killing of children by lethal injection from the autonomy of the individual to arguing: why do you want to allow them to suffer? Parents and guardians in Canada couldnt authorize no-treatment or the withdrawal of treatment for non-competent minors Schadenberg added saying: So the idea is well this isnt fair the law has an inequality because youre allowing adults who are capable of requesting this but not children or mature minors.If you had a child with a significant disability then the question at birth would be do you want that child to receive treatment or not and you would have the right to say yes or noSo the argument is well because we already have that therefore whats the difference between that and euthanasia? Schadenberg echoed Smiths warning that with euthanasia allowed the grounds for legally killing people keep expanding as has been demonstrated in other jurisdictions.The Netherlands adopted the Groningen Protocol in 2004 he pointed out. It gives doctors impunity to lethally inject disabled infants such as those with spinal Bifida or hydrocephalus.The CPS study shows us that the parents were the ones to ask about euthanasia. Rarely did the mature minor or child consider euthanasia Schadenberg said. The concept of euthanasia for children should be simply rejected based on the fact that children cannot consent. scource:www.lifesitenews.com,CLAIM A priest with HIV who raped children was exonerated by the Catholic Church and then crucified. False RATING False ORIGIN On 24 December 2017 the disreputable web site Neon Nettle reported that a pedophile priest with HIV who was exonerated by the Catholic Church after raping young children had met a gruesome end when he was crucified: A pedophile priest who was found guilty of raping 30 children while infected with HIV but forgiven by the Vatican has been found dead outside his church. Earlier this year Catholic priest Jose Garcia Ataulfo admitted to raping 30 young girls aged between 5 and 10 years old in Oaxaca Southern Mexico. Ataulfo was cleared of any wrong-doing by the church and didnt face any criminal charges despite the fact that he knew he was infected with HIV when he sexually abused all the children he is known to have raped. Neon Nettle is a frequent purveyor of viral fake news stories and conspiracy theories and nothing published on that site should be believed without further investigation. In this case we found no evidence that a Mexican priest named Jose Garcia Ataulfo was accused of child rape and then crucified or that such a person even exists at all. The story of the mysterious priest initially found its way into English-language media by way of the British tabloid the Daily Mail which on 20 September 2016 aggregated a report from Urgente24.com a Spanish-language news site based in Argentina. That version of the story reported only that Ataulfo had been acquitted by the Catholic Church and thus was never formally prosecuted by Mexican authorities: Ataulfo has admitted to sexually assaulting indigenous young girls from Oaxaca a state isouthern Mexico known for its large indigenous population. The priest has yet to face any criminal charges most likely due to the significant influence that the Catholic Church wields in Mexico particularly in areas populated by indigenous ethnic groups. But the ultimate problem with the story from the get-go was that Urgente24.com also based their article on an unreliable source: a report from the Mexican branch of the hacktivist group Anonymous. Nevertheless the Daily Mail report was shared thousands of times taking the unfounded story viral on multiple continents. When the Catholic News Agency (CNA) tried tracking Ataulfo to a source they came up empty. Mexican archdiocese officials told CNA they couldnt find records matching the description given for Ataulfo while Father Hugo Valdemar Romero a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Mexico told CNA that: This supposed priest does not belong to the Archdiocese of Mexico as Anonymous Mexico asserts much less has he been let off as the post irresponsibly and maliciously states. The archdiocese told CNA the name may have originally come from a list of allegedly LGBT priests a publication called Hablermos de Mexico had threatened to make public amid a national debate over marriage equality. (We sent an inquiry to the Archdiocese of Mexico but have not yet received a response.) The disturbing image attached to the Neon Nettle story appeared to be a mash-up of a digitally-manipulated picture of a real priest lifted from the web site CourageousPriest.com and sadly an image of a man who was murdered in 2014 by Al Qaeda operatives in Yemen after being accused of working for U.S. intelligence. The mans body was hung out in the open over a soccer pitch and grisly images of the results were circulated online. Neon Nettle traffics in sensational and often totally fabricated clickbait and has a penchant for publishing gruesome but false vigilante stories involving pedophilia. This tale appears to be yet another example of that proclivity.,,0,0,,

Yet another expression of this misleading technique for generating clicks is attributing the sentiment that Trump in one year is already better than 16 years of Bush and Obama put together to celebrities ranging from actress Michelle Pfeiffer to singer Dolly Parton: Neither of these women (nor any other prominent entertainer) gave voice to this thought; it was actually a paraphrase of an opinion expressed by Brett Decker a former Wall Street Journal editor and the author of the book Bowing to Beijing: How Barack Obama Is Hastening Americas Decline and Ushering a Century of Chinese Domination while discussing economic policy during a radio interview on 5 January 2018:",,0,0,,

(See evidence below.) (Follow,CLAIM A San Diego Zoo employee was hospitalized after trying to have sex with an octopus and sustaining heavy damage to his genitalia. False RATING False ORIGIN On 4 September 2017 the web site World News Daily Report published an account of what they termed a freak incident involving a San Diego Zoo employee and an octopus: A San Diego Zoo employee has been hospitalized and is lying in critical condition after allegedly trying to sexually assault a Giant Pacific Octopus. The 28-year-old employee was found partially naked and unconscious when security agents discovered the young man and alerted an ambulance. It took medical personnel several hours to successfully release the octopus that had latched itself to the mans genital area. We did the best we could but the octopuss beak has tremendous pressure and the animal had started to digest part of the mans genitals explained Dr. Julia Andrews of the San Diego Medical Center. The story is false and not just because the zoo does not display octopuses.

The New York Post reported that a government official briefed on the deadly Amtrack crash in Washington,CLAIM A U.S. surgeon who exposed Clinton Foundation corruption in Haiti was found dead in his home under suspicious circumstances. False RATING False ORIGIN On 12 December 2017 frequent purveyor of misinformation Your News Wire published a paranoid gratuitous account of a well-known surgeons suicide apparently geared to play into two widespread anti-Clinton conspiracy theories: that the Clinton family has killed (and continues to kill) their political and personal enemies and that the Clinton Foundations development work in Haiti which has been both praised and criticized exposed widespread corruption on the part of the Clintons. While the story never explicitly makes the claim that the Clintons were responsible for his death that is the conclusion it heavily implies through factually dubious innuendo. A common tactic for Your News Wire and other conspiracy-geared clickbait outlets obscures demonstrably false or scandalous claims by presenting them alongside factual reporting blurring the lines between news and hysterical propaganda. This story is no exception to that formula: Dr. Dean Lorich an orthopedic surgeon who volunteered in Haiti and exposed Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice on the island has been found dead in New York. He was 54. [] One of the United States leading surgeons Dr. Lorich was part of the relief effort sent by the U.S. to assist the relief effort led by the Clinton Foundation in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. However Dr. Lorich was disgusted by the shameful Clinton Foundation operation and voiced his concerns to Hillary Clinton directly. The first factual element of the Your News Wire story is the death of a surgeon named Dean Lorich who was found dead from a self-inflicted knife wound in his Manhattan home on 10 December 2017. His death was widely reported as he was prominent in the field of orthopedic trauma surgery; after singer Bono suffered a cycling accident in New York in 2014 Lorich operated on the rock star which led to an interview in Rolling Stone. (At the time of his death Lorich was being sued by former New York Giants runningback Michael Cox who had accused him of career-ending malpractice.) The second factual element of the Your News Wire story is that Lorich was part of a team of doctors volunteering their time in Haiti after the 12 January 2010 Earthquake. The group was primarily focused on providing emergency surgeries to save childrens limbs from amputation. He found his time there disturbing and frustrating due to the United States poor on-the-ground logistics and cowrote an opinion piece for CNN on 25 January 2010 expressing this sentiment. These facts provide the spartan structure by which Your News Wire supports a thin veneer of false statements or deliberate mischaracterizations. Most glaring perhaps is their characterization of Lorich as part of an effort associated with the Clinton Foundation. While the Clintons have had a long history with Haiti the Foundation played no role in Lorichs trip and they had no formal role in Haitian relief efforts at that time. The Clintons contacts in Haiti are mentioned briefly in Lorichs CNN piece from 2010. The politically connected and noted surgeon who organized the volunteer trip David Helfet not Lorich had reached out to Bill and Hillary Clinton for advice on conditions on the ground. Though the foundation had no formal role in Haiti at this time former President Bill Clinton had been serving as the United Nations special envoy to Haiti since May 2009. Your News Wire takes this faulty exposing corruption premise a step further going so far as to suggest that the CNN opinion piece was a response to the Clinton Foundation specifically: One of the United States leading surgeons Dr. Lorich was part of the relief effort sent by the U.S. to assist the relief effort led by the Clinton Foundation in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. However Dr. Lorich was disgusted by the shameful Clinton Foundation operation and voiced his concerns to Hillary Clinton directly. In fact the piece (which did describe the conditions as shameful) did not mention the Clinton Foundation at all making Your News Wires description that it exposed Clinton Foundation corruption patently false. The piece instead directed its criticism more broadly toward the United States overall presence in Haiti: The lack of support for our operation by the United States is shocking and embarrassing and shows how woefully unprepared we are for the realities of disasters. We came to understand that our isolated operation may work in a mission but not in a disaster. The implication that Lorich voiced his concerns to Hillary Clinton directly or reached out to anyone at the State Department personally is as well false. In a 24 January 2010 e-mail to Hillary Clinton published by WikiLeaks chief of staff Cheryl Mills forwarded a chain of messages sent to her by a friend and fellow surgeon that had itself been forwarded as part of a long e-mail chain that originated with Lorich. The message Lorich sent contains the same details that eventually became the CNN piece. However his CNN story and the forwarded messages contain no allegations of corruption and Lorich never sent the e-mail to either Mills or Clinton directly. Instead he sent the account to fellow orthopedic surgeon Christopher Born with an encouragement to share it with everyone and anyone you find might help. Lorichs death while a tragic and sudden suicide comes with no evidence of any foul play. Reports of the death as suspicious are based only on the initial report from Lorichs 11-year-old daughter who found his body to the buildings doorman who called police and described the incident as an assault. Neither individual was in a position to determine the circumstances of his death at the time. Framing Lorichs death as related to his contact with the Clintons then is based only on the false statements that he worked for the Clinton Foundation while in Haiti and that he personally was in touch with Hillary Clinton about his problems with the U.S. response to the earthquake. In reality he had no direct contact with the Clinton Foundation the Clintons or their staff. The implication that Lorich was somehow targeted by the Clintons or their foundation because of this criticism of Americas work in Haiti is based solely on the fact that he had publicly disagreed with aid decisions made by United States in the immediate response to a catastrophic natural disaster. By this standard and this does appear to be the standard Your News Wire is working with anyone who dies an unexpected death who also held a negative view of any aspect of Hillary Clintons tenure as Secretary of State would implicate the Clintons as a suspect in their death. This is not a reasonable standard and the additional evidence to support a nefarious connection was fabricated. Therefore we rank this claim as false.,,0,0,,

Mostly False RATING Mostly False WHATS TRUE Gutirrez did leave as others were chanting ""U.S.A!"" and before the presidents speech had ended. WHATS FALSE Gutirrez began preparing to leave his seat before the patriotic chanting began and says he exited the chamber in order to make it to a television interview on time. Gutirrez left as Trump was coming to the conclusion of what had been an historically long State of the Union address. ORIGIN During his 2018 State of the Union address as Donald Trump talked about monuments to freedom to historical figures and to veterans Republicans started chanting USA! As they did so about three minutes before the end of the speech Democratic Congressman Luis Gutirrez gathered up his things and walked out of the room a move that has put him at the center of a storm of outrage. Fox News in a piece headlined Democrat Luis Gutirrez Storms Out of State of the Union During USA Chant said: Rep. Luis Gutirrez turned and left the State of the Union address Tuesday just as Republicans broke into a USA chant. President Donald Trump had just finished mentioning the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol building which he then called a monument to the American people. In that section of remarks Trump also praised veterans in wars from the Revolution through World War II and today mentioning sites like Saratoga N.Y. Yorktown V.A. and the Pacific theater. As half of the gallery broke into a USA chant Gutirrez (D-Ill.) could be seen exiting his aisle seat and walking out of the chamber. Paul Joseph Watson editor-at-large of the conspiracy theory web site Infowars claimed Gutirrez left because he was triggered by the chanting. Speaking to Fox News Deputy White House Press Secretary J. Hogan Gidley responded to the Congressmans early departure from the speech saying For the life of me I cant figure out when Democrats became soanti-this country. In reality Gutirrez has dismissed these claims saying he left the chamber in order to make it to a television interview on time adding that he deliberately waited until the president had stopped speaking before leaving his seat. There is a story going around that I stormed out of the Presidents speech last night which is completely false. That I boycotted the speech or protested by leaving during an applause break is just someones spin. Luis V. Gutierrez (@RepGutierrez) January 31 2018 I was due on TV for an interview and the speech was running late. I waited until the President stopped talking and walked to the back and watched the last 90-seconds on TV (after sitting for 80 minutes). Then went to my interview. Those are the facts. https://t.co/Gq3oKwTe1O Luis V. Gutierrez (@RepGutierrez) January 31 2018 Gutirrez can be seen leaving his seat at the 1:17:22 mark in this footage during an applause break about three minutes before the end of the speech. However Gutirrez can also be seen preparing to leave his seat (at 1:17:15) before the chants of U.S.A.! began (1:17:19.). This undermines claims that Gutirrez was leaving in response to the chants. The sequence of events can be clearly seen in this short clip from the longer CNN video: We have a bipartisan standing ovation and a lot of USA! chants. https://t.co/00Kmhu7ges Meg Wagner (@megwagner) January 31 2018 The Congressmans contention that the speech was running late is also a reasonable one. At one hour and 20 minutes Trumps was the third-longest State of the Union speech in more than 50 years according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. After the speech ended Gutirrez conducted an interview with Univision. His Twitter account posted this photo at 10.43pm six minutes after the president left the chamber. You can watch an excerpt of the interview (in Spanish) here. Gutirrez who has said he will not seek re-election in 2018 has been a fervent critic of the president. After the State of the Union speech the Chicago legislator issued a statement in which he called Trump an outwardly explicitly racist American President. After the Congressmans clarification about the reasons for his early departure Fox News changed the headline on its article from Democrat Luis Gutirrez Storms Out of State of the Union During USA Chant to Democrat Luis Gutirrez Walks Out of State of the Union Early. Its true that Gutirrez left his seat as Congress members chanted U.S.A.! during Donald Trumps State of the Union speech on 30 January 2018. However there is no evidence that he did so because of those chants which came towards the end of an unusually long speech by Trump and with Gutirrez on his way to a media commitment.",,0,0,,

Do You Support Her?,Thanks in part to a long-discredited (but deeply entrenched) assertion that the MMR (Measles Mumps and Rubella) vaccine has been linked to increased rates of autism fear of vaccination has been rife on blogs and social media groups devoted to the discussion of alternative medicine. A common uniting element of such rumors is their longevity due in part to the oft-present claim that the purported vaccine truth has been covered up or buried by large interests in particular the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In October 2015 many alternative health sites published some variation of a claim the CDC had admitted that 98 million Americans had over the years been injected with a cancer-causing virus along with their polio vaccine. Then in keeping with the template of the rumor the CDC supposedly endeavored to immediately eradicate that information from any form of record. Why they admitted such a thing on the Internet in the first place rather than concealing it entirely is not addressed by the rumors: the CDC of conspiracy theory imagination is always clever enough to do retroactive clean-up in an attempt to cover their tracks but never smart enough to avoid publishing damaging information in the first place. But fortunately a few eagle-eyed folks managed to bust the vast conspiracy via the magic of Google cache: CDC admits 98 million Americans were given cancer virus via the polio shot: https://t.co/7QGE5CY3Ie pic.twitter.com/SrQ5ksEmFJ HealthRanger (@HealthRanger) October 28 2015 CDC Disappears Page Linking Polio Vaccines To Cancer-Causing Viruses https://t.co/A0ypmtOFQh CaliVaxChoice (@CaliVaxChoice) October 28 2015 On 25 October 2015 Viral Alternative News published an article titled CDC admits 98 million Americans were given a cancer causing virus via the polio shot which followed on the heels of a September 2015 article from the web site Vaccines.News headlined CDC admits 98 million Americans were given cancer virus via the polio shot (credited to a reporter by the name of evilnews) the latter of which cited InvestmentWatchs August 2015 piece titled CDC Admits 98 Million Americans Received Polio Vaccine in an 8-Year Span When It Was Contaminated With Cancer Virus: The CDC has quickly removed a page from their website which WAS cached here (since removed by Google so you can view an image of the cache here) admitting that more than 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine within an 8-year span from 1955-1963 when a proportion of the vaccine was contaminated with a cancer causing polyomavirus called SV40. It has been estimated that 10-30 million Americans could have received an SV40 contaminated dose of the vaccine. First of all the CDC never admitted that anyone ever contracted cancer from a polio vaccination. What the CDC actually said was: o Sometime around 1960 Simian Virus 40 (SV40) was discovered in the injected form of the polio vaccine (IPV). o The SV40 virus has been found in certain types of cancer in humans. o Between 1955 and 1963 when some portion of the IPV was contaminated with SV40 roughly 98 million Americans received at least one dose of polio vaccine. Clearly 98 million Americans were not given [a] cancer virus via the polio shot because not every single polio vaccination undertaken between the years of 1955 and 1963 involved vaccine contaminated with SV40: the CDC estimated that somewhere between 10 and 30 million Americans might have received SV40-contaminated vaccine during that period. Moreover SV40 is not a cancer virus and there is no definitive evidence that either SV40 itself or SV40-contaminated polio vaccine causes (or has caused) cancer. But even if the claim about the CDCs hiding evidence of a link between polio vaccine and cancer held water the short lead-in paragraph quoted above contains a number of credibility-related red flags regarding the CDCs supposedly assuming its role as the perpetual villain of the anti-vaccine movement. America is not the world and theres no plausible reason to believe that the rest of the planet would be fleeced by one countrys public health authorities engaging in a conspiracy to deceive its people about vaccines. Moreover the claim that the CDC had quickly quietly or recently redacted the information about a vaccine-cancer linkage was not new in October 2015 as iterations of it had appeared as early as July 2013. At that time Health Impact News published an article headlined CDC Disappears Page Linking Polio Vaccines to Cancer-Causing Viruses and InfoWars similar CDC Sends Fact Sheet Linking Polio Vaccine to Cancer Down the Memory Hole story reported: The Center for Disease Control and Prevention website curiously deleted pages admitting that the polio vaccine administered from 1955 to 1963 to over 98 million Americans was contaminated with a primate form of cancer virus. Other CDC web pages also referencing the link between the widely-distributed vaccine and cancer have similarly been discarded. That instance of the rumor claimed the pages had recently been deleted from Googles cache but the site linked to archived version of the pages in question here and here. The first link was titled Cancer Simian Virus 40 (SV40) and Polio Vaccine Fact Sheet and was dated 22 October 2007. If it was (ostensibly) deleted quickly and quietly by the CDC as some sort of a cover-up in 2013 that would mean it still sat openly available for viewing by all and sundry online for roughly six years. The second link was titled Frequently Asked Questions about Cancer Simian Virus 40 (SV40) and Polio Vaccine and contained such clearly damning admissions as: All of the evidence to date indicates that after 1963 all vaccines on the U.S. market were free of SV40. The majority of evidence suggests there is no causal relationship between receipt of SV40-contaminated polio vaccine and cancer development; however some research results in this area are conflicting and more studies are needed. Since the discovery of SV40 several studies have been done to compare cancer rates in groups of individuals known or strongly presumed to have received SV40-contaminated polio vaccine to rates in persons known or strongly presumed not to have received SV40-contaminated vaccine. In summary the majority of studies in the U.S. and Europe that compare persons known or strongly presumed to have received SV40-contaminated polio vaccine with those known or strongly presumed not to have received SV40-contaminated polio vaccine have not shown a causal relationship between receipt of SV40-contaminated polio vaccine and cancer. It should be noted however that SV40 infection has been found in persons who did not receive SV40-contaminated polio vaccine and that for some study participants it cannot be known with certainty whether or not they received SV40-contaminated vaccine. Because of this there may be errors in these studies that make it harder to detect a true increased cancer risk associated with receipt of SV40-contaminated polio vaccine. It should be noted that the study of SV40 with respect to cancer and polio vaccines is neither novel nor has in any way been suppressed: as the quoted portion above explained the concern was identified and addressed prior to 1963. A 2001 study indicated that large epidemiologic studies have not identified an elevated cancer risk in persons who received SV40-contaminated vaccines [administered before 1963] and found no deaths due to tumors of the types putatively associated with SV40. The findings were described in that research as consistent with other negative epidemiologic investigations of risks from SV40-contaminated vaccines although further research was recommended. Research published in 2004 echoed those findings: Although SV40 causes cancer in laboratory animals substantial epidemiological evidence has accumulated to indicate that SV40 likely does not cause cancer in humans. However additional laboratory research is needed to better define methods for SV40 detection as laboratory studies looking for SV40 DNA in human tumors have offered conflicting results. There is also a need to conduct additional studies evaluating cancer patients and controls for antibodies to SV40 which would be present in cancer patients if SV40 causes cancer. Nonetheless anti-vaccine blogs and sites continually assert that the CDC has admitted or covered up information in a manner that relies on a relative lack of context on the part of the reader to spread. In this case the rumor relied on the reader not knowing that SV40 concerns were well documented in medical literature and long considered resolved. By the same token redaction conspiracies are primed to circulate in perpetuity each time the CDC is accused of newly burying information in a manner not immediately verifiable by site visitors (i.e. its difficult to corroborate information that has purportedly been deleted). But concern over SV40 and vaccines was addressed and dealt with by 1963 50 years prior to the 2013 outbreak of the rumor. It was hardly an assertion revealed only by alternative health sites crafty usage of Google caching and a multitude of studies combed through subsequent cancer rates to identify subsequent elevated risk. None was found a fact which also was no secret and was long-documented. Moreover the web documents the CDC was breathlessly accused of deleting were clearly marked Last Updated: 22 October 2007 while cover-up accusations dated to July 2013. Far likelier than a conspiracy was the fact that the pages were last relevant and useful in October 2007 and theyve since been replaced with updated information hosted on separate pages at CDC.gov. In fact a search for SV40 polio and cancer on the CDC web site returns a number of related links to CDC pages inconsistent with claims the CDC has disappeared such information (rather than replaced it with more current data). The cached pages linked above still lead to dated information on CDC.gov but none of it meaningfully conflicts with more up-to-date information about long-retired vaccine strains.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN Back in July 2015 the fake news web site Newswatch33 published an article titled NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 15 Days of Complete Darkness in November 2015 reporting that: NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 15 days of total darkness between November 15 and November 29 2015. The event according to NASA hasnt occurred in over 1 Million years. Astronomers from NASA have indicated that the world will remain in complete darkness starting on Sunday November 15 2015 at 3 a.m. and will end on Monday November 30 2015 at 4:15 p.m. According to officials the November Black Out event will be caused by another astronomical event between Venus and Jupiter. Charles Bolden who was appointed to head of NASA by President Obama issued a 1000 page document explaining the event to the White House. This bit of fake news was lifted from an older (debunked) viral rumor that had already been around the online block several times before and has long since become an evergreen online hoax a jape that is typically resurrected a few times a year by dubious web sites that simply update the time span for the alleged period of darkness and send it winging around the Internet again. While Charles Bolden is a real NASA official he issued no report or announcement about 15 days of darkness. Moreover Newswatch33 web site was not a legitimate news outlet but a fake news site that began darkening the doorstep of social media networks shortly after the nearly identical NewsWatch28 fake news site shut down in mid-2015.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN A series of images purportedly showing the skeletal remains of the biblical figure Goliath along with the claim that the massive fossil had recently been unearthed in Jerusalem gained popularity online in February 2018: The images which show neither a Goliath skeleton nor a recent archaeological discovery have been online in various forms for more than a decade. Each image used in the graphic above has a different origin. Goliath Skeleton The idea of a Goliath skeleton likely originates with the infamous tabloid the Weekly World News. The tabloid published images purportedly showing the giants slingshot-wounded skull in their June 1993 issue and then followed that up with a series of stories about the fictional discovery complete with quotes from made-up archaeologists. Quotes from that 24-year-old article are still used today. For instance Daily Voice used a Weekly World News quote attributed to the (fictional) archaeologist Dr. Richard Martin in their in their February 2018 Goliath article: Archaeologist Dr. Richard Martin says: We found the skull in the Valley of Elah in the foothills of the Judean Mountains where Davids battle with Goliath took place. The skull is huge and clearly belongs to a man of enormous stature. Tests show that the skull is between 2 900 and 3 000 years old about the right time for the biblical battle. Dr. Martin says: This is the archaeological find of the year. The Goliath discovery is neither recent nor real. Weekly World News was a sensational tabloid that frequently published outrageous claims including the existence of bat boy a half-boy half-bat superhero. The June 1993 issue with the Goliath story also included far-fetched reports about whales trained to ram drug boats and an army of ants that ate 935 people. Giant Skull This image originated in a 2008 hoax photograph contest called Archaeological Anomalies 12 on the web site Worth 1000: In this contest you will create a hoax archaeological discovery maybe Atlantis a 2000 year-old Coca-Cola can or a giants skull. Be open minded there are many mysteries buried beneath the earth. The rules of this game are thus: You are to create an archaeological hoax. Your job is to show a picture of an archaeological discovery that looks so real had it not appeared at Worth1000 people might have done a double take. Several people submitted manipulated images appearing to show giant skeletons. A user calling themselves blackbook created the image above. Giant Skeleton This image was also created for a Worth 1000 contest this time calling for images that play with size and perspective. The user Whitmath57 created the image. Skeleton Display The final image shows a sculpture by the Italian artist Gino De Domonicis. The work titled Calamita Cosmica (in English Cosmic Magnet) toured Europe before finding a home at the Museo Nazionale delle Arti del XXI Secolo in Rome Italy. Flickr user Mauro took this particular photograph in 2007. The sculpture aside from being gigantic also had a unique pointy nose a common theme in Domoniciss work according to Atlas Oscura: [Photo via giuliaduepuntozero] None of the images show the skeleton of the biblical figure Goliath. Weve investigated several giant skeleton photographs in the past but have yet to encounter a genuine photographic record of a giant. If you come across an image purporting to show the remains of Goliath chances you are looking at the results of digital editing software forced perspective or some sort of artwork.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 29 January 2018 the YourNewsWire web site published an article reporting that an NFL entertainment lawyer was found dead hours after telling reporters that the upcoming Super Bowl was rigged: An NFL entertainment lawyer who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is rigged. Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an gangland-style execution hours after blowing the whistle on the rigged Super Bowl backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis. Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series along with one other man believed to be a close friend. Goodes an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football Leagues Park Avenue headquarters had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sundays Super Bowl featuring the two teams. However Goodes went off-script in Minneapolis and was physically removed from the premises by security staff but not before publicly condemning the NFL as totally corrupt and claiming the Super Bowl is fixed. None of this was true. The NFL employs no entertainment lawyer named Dan Goodes nor did anyone by that name recently blow the whistle on rigged football games or die in a gangland-style execution. This report was a fabrication nothing more than a riff on a recent hoax about NFL games being rigged that was published by YourNewsWire a fake news site.

False RATING False ORIGIN One of the most salient moments from Rep. Joe Kennedy IIIs (D-Mass.) response to State of the Union address came when he rebuked President Trumps promise to build a wall along the Mexican border in an attempt to stop illegal immigration: America we carry that story on our shoulders. [] You probably marched together last weekend thousands deep on the streets of Las Vegas and Philadelphia and Nashville. You sat high atop your moms shoulders and held a sign that read Build a wall and my generation will tear it down. Some attempted to paint Kennedy as hypocritical for this comment by passing around a photograph purportedly showing Joe Kennedys House and the security wall that protected it: There are a number of problems with using this photograph to paint Kennedy as a hypocrite for promising to tear down a border wall. Chiefly this is not Joe Kennedys house and hasnt been in the Kennedy familys holdings for more than 20 years. This property was purchased by Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. Joe Kennedy IIIs great grandfather in 1933 but the property hasnt been in the Kennedy family for more than two decades. The Kennedy family sold the property in 1995 when Kennedy III was just 14 years old according to the New York Times: The Kennedy days in Palm Beach quietly ended today with the sale of the oceanfront property that Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. bought in 1933 as a vacation spot and that later became his sons winter White House and eventually a symbol of the familys troubles. Claiming that the pictured wall was designed to keep people off the property is also misleading. Kennedys critics may be under the impression that a walls sole purpose is to keep immigrants from crossing a border but walls have several other purposesespecially in coastal Florida where hurricanes are known to wreak havoc. In this case this wall is a seawall designed to keep the ocean not undocumented immigrants from damaging the property. This house is located on Palm Beach just a few feet from the ocean. A view of the property from Google Earth shows that a sea wall also protects neighboring properties: Its true that this photograph shows a wall outside of a house. However this house does not belong to Joe Kennedy III (and hasnt been owned by his family since 1995) and the pictured wall is a sea wall not a border wall designed to protect the house from the ocean tides.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN In January 2017 an article published on an obscure (and dubious) web site called RightWingNow.com purported to describe a bizarre form of student protest over President Donald Trumps plan to build a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico: In a bizarre form of protest University of California freshman Seth Greenberg has promised to publicly remove his penis (he did not specify the method of removal) if Donald Trump begins project work on the US Mexican border wall. Im so confident that Trump is full of shit that I will cut my dick off publicly if he adds even a mile of new wall stated Greenberg in an on the street interview where he was simultaneously protesting prayer in public school. When pressed about the validity of his claim Greenberg promised that I will really do this. I feel that if he does actually build any of the wall me removing my penis publicly will bring worldwide attention to the injustice being inflicted against the Mexican people. Other sites ran the same story with at least one adding to it by both referencing actual quotes from President-elect Donald Trump and posting a supposed picture of the student named Greenburg who threatened to cut off his penis in protest. But that picture was not of anyone named Greenburg nor did it have anything to do with the University of California system: it is actually taken from an interview with an Umpqua Community College student following a shooting attack at that school on 1 October 2015. The site that originated the Greenberg interview doubled down two days later with a second story adding another student Jakob Connulson and an alleged political group Open Borders Friends to the mix.

The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for the last two years insisting she needed breast implants and begging for a surgery. Her mother Dana Manson says she tried to convince Juliet that her breasts would grow with time but her daughter was completely obsessed with the idea of getting breast implants. She would ask us multiple times a day every day she told NBC. There was nothing in the world that she wanted more than having boobs. Ms Manson even consulted a psychiatrist with her daughter hoping to rid Juliet of her obsession. The result however was very different from what she expected. After a dozen sessions with young girl the renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez concluded that she was suffering from a severe depression and had a serious lack of self-esteem and told her mother that a surgery could be beneficial. Doctor Ramirez says the young girl has developed some serious complexes about her appearance over the years and the operation will help her get an improved image of herself. Following the psychiatrists advice Ms Manson contacted dozens on clinics in the United States and Mexico but none of them were willing to perform a breast augmentation surgery on such a young girl. She finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China where doctors were willing to perform the operation. Dana Manson decided that she would go on the trip to Asia with her daughter over the holidays and that the surgery would count as her Christmas present. They left for China on December 22 and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned. The young girl now has a 30C cup and her mother says shes extremely happy about her about her new breasts. Dana Manson told NBC that like every mother in the world she wanted her children to be happy and that Juliet was clearly unhappy about not having any breasts. The young girls story caught the worlds attention after she posted several pictures of herself on her Instagram account only hours after the surgery instantly causing a storm of reactions on the social media. Many people are denouncing the Manson parents for allowing their daughter to undergo plastic surgery at such a young age while others are blaming her psychiatrist for his recommendation. Despite the critics Dana Manson says she did what was best for her daughter and insists that she has no regrets.

False RATING False ORIGIN In January 2016 social media users began encountering an item warning that a new killer insect sighted in India harbored a virus spread through touch that was able to circulate [throughout] the entire human system in minutes. The insect and the deleterious effects of its virus were graphically shown in accompanying images the latter of which were depicted in a hand with a large number of small holes throughout the palm and fingers: New Killer Insect (See Photo) If you ever see this Insect please dont try to kill it with your bare hands or touch it this insect spreads virus to the place of bodily contact and circulates the entire human system in minutes it was first sighted in India. Be kind enough to forward this information to be families and friends do remember to educate the children never to kill an insect with bare hands or allow its secretion to touch their body. This is an SOS Alert!!!! Please Share. There was nothing to this warning however. These images were fabricated ones that combined elements from two separate and disparate life forms to produce a visceral response is viewers famously exemplified by a supposed photograph of a breast rash caused by South American larvae that was actually a melding of a picture of a human breast with an image of a lotus seed pod: The image of the allegedly virus-infected fingertips seen in the upper right-hand corner above is actually one that has long circulated online as an example of the effects of excessive computer use and was created by merging a photograph of fingers with images of lamprey mouths: The insect pictured here at least is real. Its a giant water bug a creature that is found in North America South Africa and India and is harmless to humans. These types of faked images are sometimes claimed to play on viewers who have trypophobia defined as a pathological fear of holes (particularly irregular patterns of holes). Although many people claim to experience this disorder it is not covered in scientific literature or listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: On Web sites and blogs self-diagnosed trypophobes share tales of vomiting sleep loss and anxiety attacks at the sight of such objects as honeycombs and rotting wood. They say the fears are haunting and disruptive of their daily lives. But the medical world hasnt yet embraced the phobia as real. Trypophobia isnt listed in any major dictionary or in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Attempts to add trypophobia to the Oxford English Dictionary and even to establish a Wikipedia page have been rebuffed because there hasnt been any research published on the subject. A Wikipedia editor who deleted an entry on trypophobia in 2009 noted that trypophobia is likely hoax and borderline patent nonsense. The afflicted hand seen in the upper left-hand corner of the above example is similar to an effect helpfully documented in a video showing how to produce a scary-looking hand that will vex trypophobes:,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 31 January 2018 an Amtrak train carrying Republican members of Congress to a retreat struck a garbage truck that was on the tracks at 11:20 a.m. in Crozet Virginia killing one person. The tragic loss of life did not give even brief pause however to conspiracy trolls who made it their latest fodder. Although there is no evidence the collision was anything more than a horrific accident disreputable web sites like TheGatewayPundit.com YourNewsWire and InfoWars.com latched on reporting with no evidence that the incident was the result of a nefarious Deep State plot to either scare Republicans into falling in line or assassinate them depending on which crank web site or social media feed one happened to be looking at. For example InfoWars asked: Was [sic] the safety signals for the train carrying GOP leaders outside Charlottesville Va. hacked to ensure the train would crash or was the incident completely accidental? Was the Deep State trying to send a message to globalist Republicans to get back in line to jump off the Trump train after the presidents unifying message during the State of the Union? Of course the train crash might have been a complete accident but nevertheless heres some of the weird circumstances surrounding it so far. This is demonstrably false as WVIR reporter Matt Talhelm who was at the scene reported the arms of the crossing guard appeared functional and were down when the accident occurred: Now that the #train has pulled away headed to #Charlottesville @Amtrak station I can confirm the track crossing IS signalized with the arms DOWN. pic.twitter.com/9Ghrp6LZSM Matt Talhelm (@MattTalhelm) January 31 2018 YourNewsWire tried to link the accident to a raging controversy over a memo containing classified information compiled by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-California) about surveillance. Republicans including U.S. President Donald Trump are clashing with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over making the memo public. (Trump and since his election increasingly Republicans have placed themselves at odds with the U.S. intelligence community.) YourNewsWire reported: The timing could not be more auspicious. Trump aides [sic] have been warning that the Deep State could attempt a False Flag this week as they desperately try to distract from the release of the FISA Abuse memo. Less than twelve hours after President Trump was caught on a hot mic telling a colleague that the memo would 100% be released the Deep State killing machine whirred into life and attempted to cause mass carnage on the Amtrak rails. Remarkably these sites claimed to have this highly sensitive trove of (conflicting unsourced unattributed) information hours before the lead investigative agency on the incident the National Transportation Safety Board had made any public comments about the collision. Disreputable sites and conspiratorial social media users alike pushed the idea that the Deep State a pejorative term for an alleged amorphous amalgam of U.S. intelligence agencies and illuminati operatives plotted against Republican members of Congress in the wake of a relatively uneventful State of the Union address delivered by President Trump one day earlier. They claimed that U.S. spies and secret power brokers feared the address would rally the country behind Trump. Worth noting: None of the GOP members of Congress on the train were seriously hurt. According to witnesses including lawmakers who were on board the train headed to a retreat in West Virginia the train hit a garbage truck that was on the tracks. Images posted to social media show the damaged locomotive on the tracks and the obliterated remains of the truck.

Marshall Rogers (R-Kansas) who is a medical doctor got out of the train and performed CPR on the garbage truck driver according to posts written by his wife Laina on his official Twitter feed. The University of Virginia Health System reported that six people had been transported to UVA Medical Center one in critical condition.

Amtrak continues to work closely with Operation Lifesaver to communicate the dangers of grade crossings. Each year about 2000 people are killed or injured in grade crossing and trespassing incidents nationwide. Although the exact cause of the accident isnt known theres no evidence to support claims being made by notoriously unreliable web sites that there was any foul play let alone a massive Deep State conspiracy to harm Republican legislators. These sites have misled readers numerous times before. Their modus operandi appears to involve seizing on the early moments of American tragedies to publish unvetted claims and outright lies during the time when real journalists are still working to report and verify facts. In the past YourNewsWire for instance posted a viral story that falsely reported that a second gunman had opened fire on a music festival crowd during the 1 October 2017 mass shooting. Gateway Pundit named the wrong person as the Las Vegas shooter. InfoWars helped spread false information about the identity of a man accused of starting recent California wildfires. Sites like YourNewsWire Gateway Pundit and InfoWars have made it a habitual practice to cynically exploit tragedies and spread false information about them for their own purposes.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN A video purportedly showing Jay-Z punching a young girl gets passed around the internet from time to time in an apparent attempt to smear the musician. When Jay-Z performed a concert to benefit Hillary Clinton in November 2016 for instance this 3-second clip was shared along with the dubious claim that it showed the musician striking an underage girl at the rally. The clip was circulated a few months later with similar claims after Jay-Z criticized President Trump for his alleged shithole remark about African countries. It was also shared in previous years as if it showed Jay-Z punching a 12-year-old girl for trying to hug him or slapping an underage girl for taking his picture: This footage is real but the claims frequently attached to it seem to be made up out of whole cloth. The web sites and social media accounts sharing this video frequently post it as if they were privy to specific details about the encounter (such as the age of the girl or the reason for the altercation) yet information about where and when this incident occurred is almost always neglected. The provided details also change with each posting: Is the girl 12? Is she a teenager? Did she try to hug Jay-Z or take his picture? Whatever the situation its difficult to verify based solely on the images in this 3-second clip. Of course thats problematic as we never actually get a good look at the victim in this video and its limited runtime provides little to no context about the encounter. When we searched for more information about this clip we found that the person in the video was an adult not a child that they were an old friend and employee not a fan and that all parties involved said that the altercation was friendly in nature. This clip first appeared in a 2000 documentary called Backstage about Jay-Zs Hard Knock Life Tour but it didnt start creating controversy until it was picked up by music gossip web sites in 2004. Again the footage was shared with sensational claims about what it showed yet provided little in the way of context: Apparently Jay-Z had a problem with a female in a shocking video that was pulled out of the archives of the Backstage DVD by HipHopDX. As of this time I have yet to hear from my numerous contacts at Roc-A-Fella in regards to Jay-Zs side to this affair. But if pictures speak louder than words then Jigga-man has some explaining to do. The assault looks unprovoked as HOVA walks into what looks like a backstage area of a concert venue. As Mr. Carter walks into the room he has a rather irritated look upon his face and without hesitation lashes out at an unidentified female in the video. The video is briefbut shows a lot. Shortly after this video went viral in 2004 Jay-Z addressed the controversy and explained that the woman in the footage was actually his good friend music executive Chaka Pilgrim who is currently the president of Roc Nation Records and that they were just playing. Pilgrim and director Chris Fiore backed up Jay-Zs story with Fiore adding that the moment was poorly edited and left out footage of Pilgrim and Jay-Z smiling and hugging after the altercation: Jay-Z has found out what its like to be the victim of a bad rap. The hip-hop star has come under fire because of a scene in the 2000 concert documentary Backstage in which he appears to strike a woman who takes his picture after a performance. Jay told us last week that the woman Chaka Pilgrim is one of my best friends insisting We were playing. Now Backstage director Chris Fiore is corroborating that the hand-to-face smoosh was playful. Whats more Fiore admits to us he left out footage where they both laughed and hugged immediately afterward. The shot in question was taken out of context by me and was used in the film to create a sense of heightened tension at the end of the tour Fiore says. Pilgrim who works for Jays Rocawear company confirms theyre still pals and that we were just playing around. We reached out to Fiore for more information about the clip and he reiterated that it was cut just before Jay-Z and Chaka hugged and laughed about the incident. He also added that the claim that the video showed an underage girl was disturbing since Chaka was Jay Zs business manager at the time: To me the most disturbing aspect of the clip is that Chaka is labeled an underaged girl. A diminutive super intelligent woman who does not suffer fools lightly she was Jays business manager at the time and had been for years. Theyd been through a lot together and their relationship was as much brother/sister as business partners. Like many siblings they sometimes engaged in a little roughhouse play. The fact that Chaka still works for Jay two decades later says something though no? Gossip columnists Joanna Molloy and George Rush provided more details in their book Scandal: A Memoir: I cant believe that we had a nice conversation and then you turn around and run that story Jay said. I cant believe that you slapped a woman in the face and you think thats okay Joanna said. First of all shes one of my best friends he countered. Her name is Chaka Pilgrim. She works for me. And secondly I didnt strike her I gave her a smoosh. It was all set up ahead of time. She was in on it. Well thats not a true documentary then said Joanna. And Im not the only one complaining about it. [] (Joanna) talked to Chaka Pilgrim and Backstage director Chris Fiore. They both backed up Jays story. They could have been towing his line out of loyalty or fear but Joanna didnt think so. We ran their side of things in a follow-up story. It should also be noted that this clip originated in a documentary about Jay-Z and that was co-produced (according to IMDB) by Chaka Pilgrim. Although the exact details of this encounter are still unclear (was the incident staged or not?) it certainly doesnt show Jay-Z punching a 12-year-old girl.,,0,0,,

Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription ABC News tells us. But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbook ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 Last month Nelsons attorney Gloria Allred refused to confirm the authenticity of the yearbook and wouldnt hand it over to handwriting experts unless a US Senate Committee agreed to conduct a hearing first. Meanwhile author and former music journalist Thomas Wictor pointed out what appeares to be different ink used on portions of Nelsons yearbook: Well unretouched CNN photo DEFINITELY shows that ""Moore D.A. 12-22-77 Olde Hickory House"" was written in different-colored ink than the rest of the inscription. It appears that this jalopy of an accusation has completely fallen apart. pic.twitter.com/IiA0QP0l2R Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 14 2017 Meanwhile Nelsons stepson Darrel Nelson claims that his stepmothers accusations are one hundred percent a lie stating I know for a fact that there is a lot that that woman does not tell the truth on Nelson claimed in an in-person interview with Breitbart News. Do I think that Beverly is trustworthy? No I really dont. Could I see her making it up? The odds are in that favor. Everything from Nelsons age when she began working at the Olde Hickory House where she claims the assault took place to the restaurants hours to the physical layout of the location Nelson says Moore assaulted her have been called into question aided by the testimony of former Old Hickory House employee Rhonda Ledbetter a waitress at Olde Hickory House for almost three years from 1977-1979 along with another former employee. In addition two former waitresses and two former customers say they never say Moore come into the restaurant despite Nelsons claim that he was there almost every night. According to Ledbetter Olde Hickory House required employees to be 16 years old. Nelson claims she was 15 when she started . . According to two former employees the dumpsters were on the side of the building. Nelson claimed that they were in the back. Olde Hickory House sat right off of the four-lane highway and had a wrap-around porch with lights all around it. Nelson claimed that the surroundings were dark and isolated. Rhonda Ledbetter who worked at Olde Hickory House for almost 3 years states that the earliest it closed was at 11 p.m. but she believes it was open until midnight . She is certain it did not close at 10:00 because Goodyear was next door and employees came to eat when their shift ended at 10 p.m. Nelson claims her story occurred after the restaurant closed at 10 p.m. . She is certain it did not close at 10:00 because Goodyear was next door and employees came to eat when their shift ended at 10 p.m. It is unlikely that there was an entrance from the back of the parking lot which Nelson claimed existed . Multiple sources have claimed that everyone parked on the sides of the building because there wasnt much room behind the restaurant according to Rhonda not enough room to turn around. Renee Schivera stated that a neighborhood backed up to the parking lot and it was adjacent to the backyards of peoples houses so she did not see how there would have been a back entrance as it would have gone through someones yard. . Multiple sources have claimed that everyone parked on the sides of the building because there wasnt much room behind the restaurant according to Rhonda not enough room to turn around. Nelson claimed that Judge Roy Moore came in almost every night and sat at the counter but former employees state that customers at the counter were served by the bartender or short order cook not served by the waitresses and had no reason to interact with the wait staff. Additionally two former waitresses and two former patrons state they never saw Judge Moore come into the restaurant. Other Moore accusers have been called out As Radio host Mark Levin pointed out on his show last week that there are several aspects of the case which dont really make sense. To recap; a Washington Post reporter overheard a rumor at a Roy Moore event in Alabama about Moore sexually abusing four girls 38 years ago then found the women interviewed them and the rest is history. Levin raised the following questions: How did the WaPo reporter know there were four women who they were and how to contact them? How is it that the reporter happened to overhear a rumor about four women who dont know each other and have never met yet the anonymous source the WaPo reporter ran into happened to know each girls story and how to contact them? yet the anonymous source the WaPo reporter ran into happened to know each girls story and how to contact them? Why hasnt any of this been reported in Moores 38 years in politics? And why now a month before an important election to fill Jeff Sessions senate seat? Adding to the list of questionable circumstances is the revelation that one of Moores accusers Debbie Gibson worked as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and is actively campaigning for Moores Democrat opponent Doug Jones. As New York Times bestselling author Attorney and Law professor James Hirsen points out: The Washington Post failed to disclose that one of Moores accusers was a sign language interpreter for Joe Biden and is a volunteer for Moores Democrat opponent. James Hirsen (@thejimjams) November 10 2017 Heres Gibson hard at work for Hillary: Another Moore accuser Leigh Corfman has claimed several pastors at various churches made sexual advances at her. This 3x divorcee who has also filed for bankruptcy three times. Purportedly Moores main accuser Leigh Corfman has had three divorces filed for bankruptcy three times and has been charged with multiple misdemeanors. Posts on Moores FB page indicate that Corfman has claimed several pastors at various churches made sexual advances at her. James Hirsen (@thejimjams) November 10 2017 The Star reports: She says that her teenage life became increasingly reckless with drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt when she was 16. As the years went on Corfman says she did not share her story about Moore partly because of the trouble in her life. She has had three divorces and financial problems. While living in Arizona she and her second husband started a screen-printing business that fell into debt. They filed for bankruptcy protection three times once in 1991 with $139689 in unpaid claims brought by the Internal Revenue Service and other creditors according to court records. In 2005 Corfman paid a fine for driving a boat without lights. In 2010 she was working at a convenience store when she was charged with a misdemeanor for selling beer to a minor. The charge was dismissed court records show. The WaPo reporter who penned the article wrote fake check according to an 2011 Red State report Ms. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown. Ms. McCrummens criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654 a violation of the Article 19 False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code. Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless. With the election just four days away Beverly Nelsons admission seems like legal ass covering. Can you imagine of Moore lost and then it emerged that she altered the yearbook?

Moore has continued to deny the allegations as the Alabama Senate race quickly nears an end.",CLAIM The FBI was on its way to a residence owned by the Clintons when a fire destroyed a room full of servers and hard drives. False RATING False ORIGIN On 3 January 2018 a small fire broke out on a property owned by Bill and Hillary Clinton in Chappaqua New York and was quickly extinguished: A fire broke out Wednesday at property owned by Bill and Hillary Clinton in Chappaqua N.Y. authorities said. The flames erupted in the ceiling of the second floor in a Secret Service structure behind the Clintons home a Secret Service spokesman told Fox News. He said the Clintons were not on the property at the time. No injuries were reported. The fire naturally sparked a series conspiracy theories and claims that the blaze was somehow suspicious and that it was related to some sort of criminal activity. The Last Line of Defense a repeat fake news offender put up an article appearing to report (falsely like everything else on the site) that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was on their way to the Clinton compound with a warrant when the fire broke out: FBI Special Agent Scott MacTaggart has confirmed to Fox News that he and his team were on their way to serve a warrant on the Clinton residence in Chappaqua New York when they got word that a fire had broken out. Their mission was scrubbed and they were sent back to Manhattan to regroup. Conspiracy theory dabblers YourNewsWire.com went a step further claiming without offering any proof whatsoever that the fire had destroyed a room full of computer servers: A room full of servers and hard drives was destroyed in the Clinton house fire in Chappaqua New York on Wednesday according to a Chappaqua Fire Department source raising fears that incriminating evidence against the Clintons has been destroyed just days after a White House insider warned that Trump was preparing to prosecute their crimes. I saw smashed up hard drives melted memory cards and the charred remains of paper scattered all over the room and immediately knew the fire must have started there a Chappaqua Fire Department source told local news reporters explaining that the house fire was put out by Secret Service agents before the Fire Department arrived. The Last Line of Defense article can be debunked by simply glancing at the disclaimer at the bottom of any page that labels all its content as satire. The site (now TheLastLineOfDefense.online previously TheLastLineofDefense.org) also has a long history of publishing misinformation and states on its About page that everything it publishes is fiction. YourNewsWire.com lacks credibility for different reasons: It frequently uses dubious tactics to promote conspiracy theories that have little to no basis in reality. In this article for instance they quoted a Chappaqua Fire Department source about the alleged destroyed servers. However they did not provide any verifying information (such as the name of the outlet) or a link to the original report. We also found no record of this quote in any legitimate news articles indicating that someone most likely fabricated this quote out of the whole cloth. Your News Wire also included a photograph purportedly showing the equipment that was destroyed in the fire but the image was not taken at the Clintons residence in New York; it was originally published in an article about data recovery for California fire victims on the company web site of Kroll Ontrack: Although YourNewsWire.com does not carry a disclaimer explicitly stating that its content is either fiction or misinformation its writers do include a message excusing themselves from any responsibility for inaccuracies in their articles: The information software products and services included in or available through the site may include inaccuracies or typographical errors.

False RATING False ORIGIN Hundreds of thousands of Facebook users in February 2018 shared an article warning that the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline had issued a massive recall of Ventolin inhalers an essential medicine for many people with asthma. The post by TodayViral.News is a hoax. It rehashes an actual Ventolin recall which took place in April 2017. GlaxoSmithKline is recalling nearly 600000 prescription inhalers over defects the FDA announced. The voluntary recall targets Ventolin HFA (albuterol sulfate) Inhalation Aerosol distributed via prescription nationwide. The manufacturer said the drug delivery system is defective. TodayViral.News used the sensationalist headline 600000 inhalers recalled for defects Share to Save a Life!! lending a false urgency to the fake story which could put peoples health at risk. In reality a check of the web sites of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and GlaxoSmithKline shows there was no new Ventolin inhaler recall in February 2018. We contacted the FDA for comment on the hoax but had not heard back by press time. In April 2017 GlaxoSmithKline announced it was recalling almost 600000 Ventolin HFA inhalers because a propellant leakage in the inhalers had caused them to emit a lower dosage of the medication albuterol. The following month the company expanded the recall including additional batches of the Ventolin HFA inhaler the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America reported. A spokesperson for GlaxoSmithKline told Reuters at the time that the recall did not represent a risk to the public and that the public were not required to return any affected inhalers. On 18 February 2018 after this article was originally published the company announced a recall of a different product Ventolin Diskus which is a dry powder inhaler used to relieve bronchospasm. That recall was limited to Canada. On 21 February 2018 the company announced a separate recall of certain lots of the Ventolin Accuhaler in the U.K. Once again the cause was a manufacturing problem which led to a small number of units not delivering the full number of doses according to the U.K. governments Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency.,,0,0,,

Mostly False RATING Mostly False WHATS TRUE President Obama reportedly used the term ""shit show"" in private to refer to the escalating violence in Libya following the death of Muammar al-Qaddafi. WHATS FALSE President Obamas comment was about an escalating war not the country itself; Obamas remarks were widely reported by the media at the time. ORIGIN During an Oval Office meeting on immigration on 11 January 2018 President Donald Trump reportedly used the term shit hole in reference to African countries and said that hed rather take immigrants from places like Norway. The comment was widely condemned in the media (several news anchors bluntly called the president a racist) and countries such as Botswana and Haiti released statements calling for an apology from the President of the United States. As the fury grew over Trumps comments some conservative web sites published articles which attempted to defend Trump and paint the media as hypocritical by pointing to a seemingly similar comment President Barack Obama made in 2016. Truth Feed News for instance claimed that Obama used the term shit show in reference to Libya and that the remark was ignored by the media: This round of whataboutery is rooted in some trutheven though it misses the point that beyond the use of a profane term context and broader implications have earned different responses. Trumps comment when paired with his isolationist immigration policies and gross generalizations about criminality of black and brown people was widely interpreted to be racist. Conversely Obama reportedly used the term shit show in private to refer to the escalating violence in Libya. However this comment was covered by the mainstream media at the time (something Truth Feed News must have been aware of since they referenced two mainstream reports in their article claiming that the mainstream media ignored the comments). Obamas coarse language was first mentioned in an interview with The Atlantic: So we actually executed this plan as well as I could have expected: We got a UN mandate we built a coalition it cost us $1 billionwhich when it comes to military operations is very cheap. We averted large-scale civilian casualties we prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict. And despite all that Libya is a mess. Mess is the presidents diplomatic term; privately he calls Libya a shit show in part because its subsequently become an ISIS havenone that he has already targeted with air strikes. It became a shit show Obama believes for reasons that had less to do with American incompetence than with the passivity of Americas allies and with the obdurate power of tribalism. When I go back and I ask myself what went wrong Obama said theres room for criticism because I had more faith in the Europeans given Libyas proximity being invested in the follow-up he said. He noted that Nicolas Sarkozy the French president lost his job the following year. And he said that British Prime Minister David Cameron soon stopped paying attention becoming distracted by a range of other things. Outlets such as TruthFeedNews attempted to draw a direct parallel between Obamas shit show comment in 2016 and President Trumps shithole remark in 2018. The conspiracy-rooted InfoWars even chastised reporters and implored the mainstream media to look into BOs vocabulary. Although its true that Obama and Trump both used a similar vulgarity these remarks were spoken in different contexts. Obama was referring to the aftermath of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafis death in 2011 which included a civil war and a growing ISIS presence in the country. Obama later said that this was the biggest mistake of his presidency. Although there are varying accounts of Trumps exact phrasing his shithole remark was made to describe entire nations in regard to immigration policy: President Trump grew frustrated with lawmakers Thursday in the Oval Office when they discussed protecting immigrants from Haiti El Salvador and African countries as part of a bipartisan immigration deal according to several people briefed on the meeting. Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here? Trump said according to these people referring to countries mentioned by the lawmakers. NBC News gave a similar account: .@NBCNews source: As Durbin explained how deal would impact ppl from Haiti Trump said Haiti? Why do we want people from Haiti here? Then they got Africa. Why do we want these people from all these shithole countries here? We should have more people from places like Norway. Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) January 11 2018 Its true that Obama and Trump both used a vulgarity at one point during their presidencies. However Obama used the term shit show to refer to the escalating violence in Libya following Gaddafis death in 2011. President Trump used the term shit hole to describe countries in Africa and elsewhere during a meeting on immigration in the Oval Office.",,0,0,,

False RATING False WHATS TRUE Newsweek offered a law professors hypothetical musings about how Hillary Clinton could still become president if Donald Trumps 2016 win was proved to have been the result of a corrupted election process. WHATS FALSE Newsweek neither reported that President Trump would be impeached nor that if so he would be replaced by Hillary Clinton. ORIGIN Back in October 2017 Lawrence Lessig the Roy L. Furman professor of law and leadership at Harvard Law School penned a short speculative essay about What should happen if the unthinkable happens that is what steps the U.S. government should take if the investigation by Robert Mueller head of the Special Counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections should find specifically damaging evidence about the President regarding a conspiracy with the Russians to affect the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The gist of Lessigs piece was that in the case of a tainted presidential election the U.S. Constitution provides no mechanism for holding a new election or otherwise installing the proper winner in office the most that could happen under current law would be for the sitting President to be impeached and removed from office (or resign) with the Vice President (or someone else in the line of succession) taking his place: Theres no mechanism in American law for a new election. Nor is there a mechanism for correcting the criminal results of the previous election. The question Im asking here is what should happen if Trump conspired with a foreign government to get elected? If he did that then what should happen. If that is shown then the first step is obvious. Trump should resign or if he doesnt he should be impeached. The second step should be obvious as well: Pence should resign or if he doesnt he should be impeached. He benefited from the criminal (and treasonous) conspiracy just as much as Trump. He shouldnt benefit even more by becoming the residual President. Under the law as it is this leaves Paul Ryan as President. And the hard moral question that Ryan would then face is whether he should remain as President. By hypothesis were assuming the office was effectively stolen from the legitimate winner by a criminal and treasonous act of the (previous) leader of Ryans own party. Ryans being President is just the fruit of that poisonous tree. So should he just ignore that? Or should he acknowledge the wrong and act to make it right? Lessig thereupon provided a possible (if far-fetched) scenario under which losing presidential candidate Hillary Clinton could still become president under existing law: President Ryan would have the right to nominate a Vice-President. That right is specified in the 25th Amendment. That nominee then becomes Vice-President once confirmed by a majority of both houses. Thats how Gerald Ford became Vice President. And thats how he eventually became President without ever running for that office. If Ryan became President because the Trump/Pence campaign committed treason who should he nominate as his Vice President? The answer seems unavoidable: He should nominate the person defeated by the treason of his own party and then step aside and let her become the President. Lessigs essay was picked up by Newsweek magazine and as the law professor noted in a preface he added to the original their reference to his piece prompted some rather vitriolic reaction: The piece was picked up by Newsweek and astonishingly (for Newsweek) all my qualifications were stripped away. Mine wasnt an essay mapping the consequences under our Constitution of a hypothetical that people are actually asking about; it was a fantasy piece by a liberal law professor dreaming about how Clinton could become President. That caught the attention of Rush Limbaugh (yea youll have to find that link yourself) who knickers twisted lambasted me on his radio show. I only knew this because scores of outraged Rushies rushed in to discipline me offering free advice about whether I was a moron or worse and disgusted at the idea that someone like me was teaching law. Tucker Carlson then asked me to come on his show. And amazingly (and to his credit) he allowed me plenty of time to set the context and explain the piece. He even affirmed that if the hypothetical were true hed be leading the charge to have Trump removed. But by the end he too got all pc about whether I should write such pieces. It was a kind of pornography he suggested and wrong for me to write. Newsweek revisted Lessigs essay in January 2018 and the author pointed out that he was not declaring that President Trump had been part of some conspiracy to steal the election nor was he asserting that the scenario he described for putting Hillary Clinton in office would (or should) happen; he was merely speculating about what could happen in one very specific circumstance: This is one way it could happen Lessig said. But thats very different from saying I think it will happen or should happen or [that] the evidence is there for it to happen. Since the essay was published there hasnt been any evidence thats come out thats resolved the question whether there was some conspiracy to steal the election the professor said. I dont feel that weve seen anything that increases that probability he added. If evidence that Trump and his team conspired to steal the election did emerge in the future however the president would have to step down Lessig maintained. Absolutely hes got to resign and if he doesnt resign then absolutely Congress needs to impeach him he said of the hypothetical situation. Lessig noted that the hypotheticals he wrote about in his essay would apply to only the specific scenario he described. The remedy that I outline[d] only makes sense if you believe the election was stolen he said. If you dont believe the election was stolen there might have been a hundred other things [Trump] did that would lead you to believe he ought to be removed but none of those justify the remedy I described. Nonetheless some dubious web sites pushed out clickbait headlines inaccurately blaring to viewers that: Newsweek Reports That Trump Will Be Impeached and Replaced by Hillary Clinton: But Newsweek neither reported that President Trump would be impeached nor that if so he would be replaced by Hillary Clinton they simply offered one persons hypothetical musings about how those events could occur (even though it was admittedly highly unlikely they ever would).,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 20 September 2017 the disreputable web site Neon Nettle published a fake news article claiming that the decapitated corpse of a pedophile named William Smith was found on the doorsteps of a judge in Dallas Texas: The body of the headless man that was discovered outside a judges home has been identified as a that of a pedophile who walked free from a recent bail hearing. William Smith 28 from Dallas Texas was discovered in the early hours of Tuesday morning decapitated and left outside the front door of a judge who had granted him bail in August. The web site Your News Wire also published this same story. Although the articles cited reports they didnt provide any links or citations indicating where they received their information. Furthermore the image featured in the articles was taken from a June 2017 WLBT report about the discovery of a headless body in Jackson Mississippi. An autopsy on the body revealed that it was 30-year-old Jeremy Jerome Jackson: Autopsy results show that 30-year-old Jeremy Jerome Jacksons head was severed while he was still alive. He also suffered a non-fatal gunshot wound to the leg. Jackson was beheaded and his torso found burned Saturday. Tuesday Jackson police announced a $20000.00 reward for information that leads to an arrest in the Jeremy Jackson murder. Through tears Johnny Jackson recounted the last time he saw his younger brother Jeremy. It was last Friday. He then got the call Saturday about his disturbing murder. From my speculation it was a message sent from somebody or to the city because you just dont kill somebody in the bushes then take their head and put it on display said Jackson. They displayed him and you could ride down the street and see it on the step. To me it was a message sent to somebody. The featured image can be seen at the 25-second mark of the video report. Jacksons severed head was left on the porch of a home. Genuine news reports about this incident made no mention of the body being found on a judges doorstep or that the victim had been a pedophile. These claims are simply the imaginings of a fake news writer.,,0,0,,

RIP Reeses peanut butter cups. Make sure to get you one before they are gone! SHARE THIS ARTICLE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY!,LOS ANGELES (AP) Mark Salling who played bad-boy Noah Puck Puckerman in the hit musical-comedy Glee died of an apparent suicide Tuesday weeks after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography. He was 35. Salling pleaded guilty in December after authorities said a search of his computer and a thumb drive found more than 50000 images of child porn. He was scheduled to be sentenced March 7 and prosecutors planned to ask a judge to send him to prison for four to seven years. A law enforcement official not authorized to speak publicly said Salling was found hanging in a riverbed area in the Tujunga neighborhood of Los Angeles. The official said the actors death is being investigated as a suicide. The Los Angeles Police Department said Salling was reported missing about 3 a.m. Tuesday. I can confirm that Mark Salling passed away early this morning the actors attorney Michael J. Proctor said in an email to The Associated Press. He did not reveal the cause of death. Mark was a gentle and loving person a person of great creativity who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgment Proctor said adding the actors family asked that its request for privacy be respected. Salling had appeared in only a handful of projects before his breakout role in Glee the popular Fox TV series about students in a high school glee club and their circle of family and friends. It aired from 2009-15. Earlier credits included 1996s Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering a 1999 guest role on the Chuck Norris series Walker Texas Ranger and a part in the 2014 TV movie Rocky Road. A singer-songwriter as well as actor he released two albums: Smoke Signals in 2008 and Pipe Dreams in 2010. Following Pipe Dreams release Salling told The Associated Press he had been a singer-songwriter long before he became an actor. I put out a record before. It went triple cardboard he joked. I was very excited about selling 125 units for that but you know this is something Ive been doing my whole life. Its not something that I just decided to randomly do now. This is not the first. It wont be the last. And I hope people enjoy it and have something to look forward to for the next round. He said he chose the albums songs from 50 to 60 he had compiled over several years. Sallings character on Glee was a member of the schools football team who ends up joining the glee club. One of his characters friends was another jock-turned-singer Finn Hudson who was played by Cory Monteith. Monteith died in 2013 from a toxic mix of alcohol and heroin according to a coroners finding. Salling was born on Aug. 17 1982 and grew up in Dallas. His survivors include his parents and a brother.,,0,0,,

In the city of Tokyo (Japan) the first restaurant in the world that legally offers Humana meat was inaugurated. A scary restaurant nicknamed The Resoto ototo no shoku ryohin which means in English Edible Brother opened its doors to the Japanese public and from all over the world where it offers its customers a varied menu where prices vary from 100 up to 1000 euros that is to say the dish with human flesh more expensive would be 1193 US dollars. International news sources have reported that a tourist from the country of Argentina was the first man to eat human flesh in the Edible Brother. This diner I think the following: It seems like eating pork in this restaurant they cook the meat with spices so the taste goes unnoticed. In Japan since 2014 a law was approved that allows the consumption of human flesh obviously conserving conditions such as the sanitary level of this and the origin. However there is no doubt that at least 99% of the world population would not agree with these grotesque acts so to speak. And the question we all ask ourselves how do they get the meat? The people before dying decide to sell their bodies to the peculiar restaurant approximately for about 30 thousand euros or 35799 dollars this is the balance that those interested can leave their families logically they are the only ones who can claim the money. Only people who die young can sign the contract in which they are subject to a special diet where the meat is suitable for consumption. And would you be willing to sell your body to be consumed after your death?,HAVANA (AP) The eldest son of late Cuban leader Fidel Castro killed himself on Thursday after months of treatment for depression state media reported. He was 68. Official website Cubadebate said Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart had been in a deeply depressed state. A brief note read on state television said his treatment had required an initial hospitalization then outpatient follow-up. The eldest son of Cubas late revolutionary leader was known for his resemblance to his father earning him the nickname Fidelito or Little Fidel. Castro Diaz-Balart had served as scientific adviser to the Council of State and was vice president of the Cuban Academy of Sciences. He studied nuclear physics in the former Soviet Union and at one point was head of Cubas nuclear program. He preferred to stay away from political issues. Castro Diaz-Balart was born to Fidel Castros first wife Mirta Diaz-Balart a woman from Cubas aristocracy who Fidel married in his youth before beginning the revolutionary struggle that later brought him and his brother Raul to power. Because of his maternal lineage Castro Diaz-Balart is cousin to Republican Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart who represents Cuban exiles in Florida. His father died in November 2016 at age 90.,,0,0,,

Canadian law allowed for the assisted medical suicide for terminally ill or suffering adults who could legally volunteer to end their own life.This law wasnt extended to children as its felt that a minor wouldnt be able to consent to their own death. Now the new legislation will pass the responsibility of consensual death over to the parents allowing them to decide whether to euthanize their child.The change was prompted by a survey by the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) that showed an overwhelming demand from parents for euthanizing children. Wesley Smith an American anti-euthanasia activist said the shift in legislation proves the morally slippery slope that a nation slides down when it decides that killing is an acceptable answer to human suffering. Writing in the National Review he said: Once euthanasia consciousness is unleashed it never stops expandingI guess Robert Latimera Canadian farmer who murdered his daughter because she had cerebral palsywas a visionary. According to LSN The CPS surveyed its members in light of the possibility Canada will expand euthanasia to children.Indeed Justin Trudeaus Liberal government had already written that possibility into the law it passed in June 2016. Bill C-14 permits voluntary euthanasia for individuals of at least 18 years of age assessed to be suffering intolerably from a grievous and irremediable medical condition and with natural death reasonably foreseeable. But the Commons Justice Committee added an amendment to the bill directing the federal government to review expanding euthanasia on three further grounds: for children or mature minors; solely for mental illness; and allowing advance directives in the case of those with degenerative diseases such as dementia. The Liberals requested the Council of Canadian Academics to review the amendments before they were quickly ushered through ParliamentThe CPS surveyed 1050 pediatricians on their experiences with medical aid in dying or MAID and released a report at the end of October.Forty-five doctors reported receiving explicit requests from parents to euthanize 91 children it said. More than half of these requests were for neonates or infants under a year old.A further 118 pediatricians had exploratory discussions about euthanasia with parents of 419 children.As for requests from the children themselves 35 paediatricians reported discussing euthanasia with 60 minors. Nine reported receiving direct requests for euthanasia from 17 minors. While such consultations may be rare minors in Canada are contemplating MAID-related concepts and approaching health care providers with MAID-related questions noted the CPS survey. Given the evolving legislative landscape it is reasonable to anticipate that such questions will increase in the near future. The CPS also conducted an attitude survey on euthanasia with 574 of a possible 1979 members or 29 percent responding.Of these 46 percent supported euthanizing mature minors who have progressive or terminal illness or intractable pain. Thirty-three percent opposed euthanizing mature minors for any reason. Mature minors are children who are allegedly capable of understanding the nature and consequences of treatment and so judged competent to request death by lethal injection.The CPS study suggested non-voluntary euthanasia for non-competent dying and/or severely disabled children is acceptable. Canadas federal law and Quebecs law previously prohibited involuntary euthanasia for anyone it said adding: However given the human rights framework advanced in Carter v. Canada the parents of a dying and/or severely disabled child who is deemed to be suffering may in the near future be looking to the courts to support a right to end their childs life. Decision-making for treatment of never-competent children is based on the best interest standard: choosing among options that reasonable persons acting in good faith on anothers behalf would consider acceptable in similar circumstances. All this is very problematic says Alex Schadenberg executive director of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition.Euthanasia lobbyists shift the argument for legalizing the killing of children by lethal injection from the autonomy of the individual to arguing: why do you want to allow them to suffer? Parents and guardians in Canada couldnt authorize no-treatment or the withdrawal of treatment for non-competent minors Schadenberg added saying: So the idea is well this isnt fair the law has an inequality because youre allowing adults who are capable of requesting this but not children or mature minors. If you had a child with a significant disability then the question at birth would be do you want that child to receive treatment or not and you would have the right to say yes or noSo the argument is well because we already have that therefore whats the difference between that and euthanasia? Schadenberg echoed Smiths warning that with euthanasia allowed the grounds for legally killing people keep expanding as has been demonstrated in other jurisdictions.The Netherlands adopted the Groningen Protocol in 2004 he pointed out. It gives doctors impunity to lethally inject disabled infants such as those with spinal Bifida or hydrocephalus.The CPS study shows us that the parents were the ones to ask about euthanasia. Rarely did the mature minor or child consider euthanasia Schadenberg said. The concept of euthanasia for children should be simply rejected based on the fact that children cannot consent.,CLAIM A woman seeking to bring her peacock along on a flight as an emotional support animal was denied permission to do so by United Airlines. True RATING True ORIGIN Most commercial airlines nowadays allow passengers with disabilities to travel with emotional support or psychiatric assist animals but as a United Airlines customer discovered recently there are certain limitations to that policy that arent up for negotiation. In late January 2018 Jet Set TV a travel talk show reported on their Facebook page that an unidentified woman and her emotional support peacock were unable to board their flight out of Newark Liberty International Airport: Incredulous? So was the bystander who shot this video of the woman entering the airport with the peacock on her shoulder: Despite the scanty details national news outlets like Fox News picked up the story after confirming with United Airlines that the woman and her peacock were in fact booked for a flight but denied boarding passes. We followed up with the airline whose spokesperson told us that the peacock did not meet the U.S. Department of Transportations support animal guidelines for a number of reasons including its weight and size. These are the DOT criteria for evaluating whether or not unusual service animals should be allowed in the passenger cabin: As indicated above certain unusual service animals pose unavoidable safety and/or public health concerns and airlines are not required to transport them. Snakes other reptiles ferrets rodents and spiders certainly fall within this category of animals. The release of such an animal in the aircraft cabin could result in a direct threat to the health or safety of passengers and crewmembers. For these reasons airlines are not required to transport these types of service animals in the cabin and carriage in the cargo hold will be in accordance with company policies on the carriage of animals generally. Other unusual animals such as miniature horses pigs and monkeys should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Factors to consider are the animals size weight state and foreign country restrictions and whether or not the animal would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others or cause a fundamental alteration (significant disruption) in the cabin service. If none of these factors apply the animal may accompany the passenger in the cabin. In most other situations the animal should be carried in the cargo hold in accordance with company policy. The same guidelines permit airlines to require documentation of a persons mental or emotional disability by a licensed health care professional before granting permission for accompaniment by a service animal. Albeit true that peacocks arent permitted to fly United theres nothing to prevent them from having an Instagram page which is how we learned that the bird in question is named Dexter and that after being turned away at the Newark Airport he was on his way across the country at last report via automobile: As it turns out Dexter the Peacock is something of a celebrity in his hometown of Bushwick New York where he lives with his owner a photographer and conceptual artist named Ventiko.,,0,0,,

The Bermuda Triangle Bermuda Triangle does not need any introduction. If you ever read anything upon the biggest unsolved mysteries in the world I am sure Bermuda Triangle wouldve topped that list! It is famous for sucking in (mysteriously) anything and everything that comes in its area. Right from flights to ships everything has lost its way in here. But what happened recently might just be the curse breaker for this scary place.click below for more link,On 15 December 2017 the Washington Post first reported that a senior CDC leader instructed policy analysts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention not to use certain words in documents related to the budget and supporting materials that are to be given to the CDCs partners and to Congress citing an unnamed policy analyst: Policy analysts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta were told of the list of forbidden words at a meeting Thursday with senior CDC officials who oversee the budget according to an analyst who took part in the 90-minute briefing. [] At the CDC the meeting about the banned words was led by Alison Kelly a senior leader in the agencys Office of Financial Services according to the CDC analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly. Kelly did not say why the words are being banned according to the analyst and told the group that she was merely relaying the information. [] Other CDC officials confirmed the existence of a list of forbidden words. Its likely that other parts of HHS are operating under the same guidelines regarding the use of these words the analyst said. The story identified seven prohibited words: Vulnerable Entitlement Diversity Transgender Fetus Evidence-based Science-based The Post reported that Kelly did not tell the group why the words are being banned and said that she was merely relaying the information. This is not the first accusation of censorship at federal agencies leveled against the Trump administration. Watchdog groups have accused the Administration of deleting or altering language on the Environmental Protection Agencys web site to downplay the role of global warming for example. On 20 October 2017 The New York Times reported: A new analysis made public on Friday found that an E.P.A. website has been scrubbed of scores of links to materials to help local officials prepare for a world of rising temperatures and more severe storms. [] Among the now-missing pages are those detailing the risks of climate change and the different approaches states are taking to curb emissions. Also edited out were examples of statewide plans to adapt to weather extremes. The CDC did not immediately return our request for comment. The Department of Health and Human Services however released a statement denying that the story is accurate: The assertion that HHS has banned words is a complete mischaracterization of discussions regarding the budget formulation process. HHS will continue to use the best scientific evidence available to improve the health of all Americans. HHS also strongly encourages the use of outcome and evidence data in program evaluations and budget decisions. Later on 17 December 2017 CDC director Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald tweeted that no words are banned: I want to assure you there are no banned words at CDC. We will continue to talk about all our important public health programs. Dr Brenda Fitzgerald (@CDCDirector) December 17 2017 In a statement emailed to Snopes Fitzgerald suggested that a staff miscommunication had occurred. I understand that confusion arose from a staff-level discussion at a routine meeting about how to present CDCs budget. It was never intended as overall guidance for how we describe and conduct CDCs work. For more than 70 years CDC has pledged to the American people that we will treat all persons with dignity honesty and respect. We take this pledge as seriously today as we did when it was written. We have asked for clarification as to what would have led Kelly to suggest that some words were problematic for the CDC budget process in the first place.,,0,0,,

Doctors have spoken separately about the truth behind chemotherapy that 97% of the time it doesnt even work. Chemotherapy and indeed the pharmaceutical industry in general is big business. Drug companies are among the richest in the world they sell the idea of health to sick people much in the same way a diet soda is sold to people in the hope that it will help them lose weight. Cancer is very much a disease of our time and most doctors will tell you that one of the easiest ways to avoid it is by holding a good diet and a healthy lifestyle. For the unfortunate ones who develop cancer when visiting a doctor there are only limited options available to them. They usually cut the cancer out good news the cancer in that part of the body has gone but the body has previously been a cancer-creating environment. The root cause of the cancer must be realized before the person can be cured. But instead of thinking about the cause of the cancer the doctors are all too happy to sell patients cancer drugs that turn them a profit. In the video Peter Glidden BS ND talks about how low the success rates for chemotherapy are and the insanity in which this medicine is not working for the patients but instead making money for the doctors. Glidden says: Why is it still used? Theres one reason and one reason only Money. He outlines that for most drugs the doctors prescribing them dont get a cut of any sales they make but chemotherapy drugs are different. There has never to this day been one decided upon cure for cancer but there are many testimonies of people who claim they cured their cancer by changing their diet and their lifestyle. These holistic stories are ridiculed by doctors even though of course they make perfect sense. The doctors do not want people treating themselves. Glidden says: Chemotherapeutic drugs are the only classification of drugs that the prescribing doctor gets a direct cut off The only reason chemotherapy is used is because doctors make money from it period. It doesnt work 97 percent of the time. If Ford Motor Company made an automobile that exploded 97 percent of the time would they still be in business? No. In another video a different doctor has a similar tale to tell. Naturopathic doctor Leonard Coldwell talks about the destructive nature of chemotherapy and that patients appear cured of their cancer because not only did the radiation kill the cancer it also scorched a bunch of otherwise healthy cells in its destructive path. He says: You killed basically every bioelectrical and biochemical function in the body Since nothing works anymore for three years you have no cancer youre cured. Youre just dead in five years. He then goes on to mention the cynical way in which doctors are forced to treat cancer patients and the problems within the medical profession. He says: You go into the medical profession the first year the first two years youre really excited youre really in it youre giving your all until you find out no matter what you do the patient gets worse or they cure themselves. Via Your Other Perspective ,CLAIM Administering three simple tests will help diagnose a stroke and pricking a stroke victims fingers will prevent further harm from the cerebral attack. Mixture RATING Mixture WHATS TRUE Three simple tests can help diagnose the occurrence of a stroke. WHATS FALSE Making a stroke victim bleed from his fingers wont prevent further harm. WHATS UNDETERMINED Asking a stricken victim to stick out his tongue may help diagnose a stroke. ORIGIN Each year an estimated 600000 Americans experience strokes which are interruptions of the blood supply to any part of the brain resulting in damaged brain tissue. Of these victims 160000 die making stroke the third leading cause of death in the U.S. Those persons this dread killer does not immediately send to the grave are often left with lifelong debilitating infirmities of speech movement and even thought. A stroke is a serious medical event both because it can (and does) kill and because it can inflict long-term harm on those lucky enough to survive it. There are two types of acute stroke: ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes account for 80 percent of all such brain attacks and occur when a blood clot lodges in a vessel responsible for supplying blood to the brain killing off part of that organ. Hemorrhagic strokes occur when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures resulting in bleeding which causes swelling and hematoma and ultimately impairs brain function. Over the years e-mail forwards and social media shares have dispensed advice to readers and users about how to identify and respond to a stroke: Examples: [Collected via e-mail 2004] How to Recognize a Stroke This might be a lifesaver if you can remember the following advice sent by a nurse whose husband is a medical doctor. Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. A stroke victim may suffer permanent brain damage when people fail to recognize whats happening. Now doctors say any bystander can recognize a stroke simply by asking three questions: ask the individual to smile. ask him or her to raise both arms. ask the person to speak a simple sentence. If he or she has trouble with any of these tasks call 911 immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher. Researchers are urging the general public to learn to ask these three questions quickly to someone they suspect of having a stroke. Widespread use of this test could result in prompt diagnosis and treatment of a stroke and prevent permanent brain damage. You may want to pass this along. [Collected via e-mail 2004] Stroke has a new indicator! They say if you forward this to ten people you stand a chance of saving one life. Will you send this along? Blood Clots/Stroke They Now Have a Fourth Indicator the Tongue: During a BBQ a woman stumbled and took a little fall she assured everyone that she was fine (they offered to call paramedics) she said she had just tripped over a brick because of her new shoes. They got her cleaned up and got her a new plate of food. While she appeared a bit shaken up Jane went about enjoying herself the rest of the evening. Janes husband called later telling everyone that his wife had been taken to the hospital (at 6:00 PM Jane passed away.) She had suffered a stroke at the BBQ. Had they known how to identify the signs of a stroke perhaps Jane would be with us today. Some dont die. They end up in a helpless hopeless condition instead. It only takes a minute to read this. A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he can totally reverse the effects of a stroke totally. He said the trick was getting a stroke recognized diagnosed and then getting the patient medically cared for within 3 hours which is tough. RECOGNIZING A STROKE Thank God for the sense to remember the 3 steps STR. Read and Learn! Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke. Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple questions: S *Ask the individual to SMILE. T *Ask the person to TALK and SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE (Coherently) (i.e. Chicken Soup) R *Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS. If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE of these tasks call emergency number immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher. New Sign of a Stroke Stick out Your Tongue NOTE: Another sign of a stroke is this: Ask the person to stick out his tongue. If the tongue is crooked if it goes to one side or the other that is also an indication of a stroke. A cardiologist says if everyone who gets this e-mail sends it to 10 people; you can bet that at least one life will be saved. I have done my part. Will you? The advice given in these much-circulated e-mails appears to be sound although it needs be pointed out that it has yet to be endorsed by the American Stroke Association. It was drawn from a report presented in February 2003 at the American Stroke Associations (ASA) 28th International Stroke Conference and news of it can be found on the American Heart Associations (AHA) web site. However as the ASA says in its official statement about the report though the research was funded by a grant from the ASA that body has not taken a position on the topic nor endorsed the test because the results though positive arose from a very small study. If the studys findings hold up it would mean that recognizing a stroke has taken place would be something just about anyone could do and would be a skill worth mastering in light of the importance of getting medical attention for stroke victims at the earliest possible moment. Focal neurological signs such as slurred speech unilateral facial droop blurred vision discoordination and partial or total paralysis are often indicative of some sort of brain dysfunction and would be recognized as important markers by those in the medical profession. However expecting laypeople to diagnose that something has gone terribly wrong in a loved one on the basis of that checklist would be reaching for too much; in that key moment few would be likely to remember what they were supposed to be looking for. The e-mailed advice as circulated in 2006 contains this additional suggestion: Another sign of a stroke is this: Ask the person to stick out their tongue. if the tongue is crooked if it goes to one side or the other that is also an indication of a stroke. While that is also likely true as a test it is far less valuable than the original three because there is room for interpretation of the results. How crooked is crooked after all? How far to one side does the tongue have to go before its having done so can be regarded as a clear sign of a stroke having occurred? Better to discard this fourth suggested test in favor of remembering the first three. By distilling the assessment process down to three simple tests (smile raise both arms speak a simple sentence) anyone is likely to remember what to ask of someone they suspect has just undergone a stroke and to correctly interpret the information so gleaned. (The tests are pass/fail after all so if the person they were administered to couldnt smile couldnt raise her arms and was incoherent the party observing all this wouldnt be at a loss for what to make of the results shed conclude her friend had undergone a stroke.) And it is important laypeople learn to recognize such events because a new drug has been shown to limit disability from strokes caused by clots (ischemic) provided victims receive it within three hours of the onset of stroke symptoms. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a clot-busting drug administered intravenously in cases of ischemic stroke; however only one in fifty stroke patients has a chance of this drug helping them because currently only 2 percent of them reach an emergency room in time for tPA to be given. (Its possible tPAs effectiveness can be boosted by simultaneous massaging of the clot with ultrasound. Early results from a 2004 study performed in Houston on coupling this drug with such treatment are most encouraging.) A 2005 updating of the e-mail included this statement: A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he can totally reverse the effects of a stroke totally. He said the trick was getting a stroke recognized diagnosed and then getting the patient medically cared for within 3 hours which is tough. While getting appropriate medical care for a stroke victim as soon as possible is extremely important doing so does not come with a 100% guarantee that a stroke identified and treated within a 3-hour timeframe will not cause permanent damage. The warning signs of a stroke are: Sudden numbness or weakness of the face arm or leg especially on one side of the body. Sudden confusion trouble speaking or understanding. Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes. Sudden trouble walking dizziness loss of balance or coordination. Sudden severe headache with no known cause. Ergo for once theres a Send this to everyone you know! missive afoot that really does contain highly useful and important information. Yet the Internet while sometimes used to disseminate actual fact (such as the above) is also often used to spread utter nonsense. Consider the following piece of cyber advice about strokes which we first saw in December 2003: First Aid for Stroke When stroke strikes the capillaries in the brain will gradually burst. When a stroke occurs stay calm. No matter where the victim is do not move him/her. Because if moved the capillaries will burst. Help the victim to sit up where he is to prevent him from falling over. Again and then the bloodletting can begin. If you have in your home an injection syringe that would be the best otherwise a sewing needle or a straight pin will do. Place the needle/pin over fire to sterilize it and then use it to prick the tip of all 10 fingers. There are no specific acupuncture points just prick about a mm from the fingernail. Prick till blood comes out. If blood does not start to drip then squeeze with your fingers. When all 10 digits is bleeding wait a few minutes then the victim will regain consciousness. If the victims mouth is crooked then pull on his ears until they are red. Then prick each ear lobe twice until two drops of blood comes from each ear lobe. After a few minutes the victim should regain consciousness. Wait till the victim regain his normal state without any abnormal symptoms then take him to the hospital otherwise if he was taken in the ambulance in a hurry to the hospital the bumpy trip will cause all the capillaries in his brain to burst. If he could save his life barely managing to walk then it is by the grace of his ancestors. I learned about letting blood to save life from Chinese traditional doctor Ha Bu-Ting who lives in Sun-Juke. Furthermore I had practical experience with it. Therefore I can say this method is 100% effective. In 1979 I was teaching in Fung-Gaap College in Tai-Chung. One afternoon I was teaching class when another teacher came running to my classroom and said in panting Mr. Liu come quick our supervisor has had a stroke! I immediately went to the 3rd floor. When I saw our supervisor Mr. Chen Fu-Tien his color was off his speech was slurred and his mouth was crooked all the symptoms of a stroke. I immediately asked one of the practicum students to go to the pharmacy outside the school to buy a syringe which I used to prick Mr. Chens 10 finger tips. When all 10 fingers were bleeding (each with a pea-sized drop of blood) after a few minutes Mr. Chens face regained its color and his eyes spirit returned too. But his mouth was still crooked. So I pulled on his ears to fill them with blood. When his ears became red I pricked his right earlobe twice to let out 2 drops of blood. When both earlobes had two drops of blood each a miracle happened. Within 3-5 minutes the shape of his mouth returned to normal and his speech became clear. We let him rest for a while and have a cup of hot tea then we helped him go down the stairs drove him to Wei-Wah Hospital. He rested one night and was released the next day to return to school to teach. Everything worked normally. There were no ill after-effects. On the other hand the usual stroke victim usually suffers irreparable bursting of the brain capillaries on the way to the hospital. As a result these victims never recover. Therefore stroke is the no. 2 cause of death. The lucky ones will stay alive but remain paralyzed for life. It is such a horrible thing to happen in ones life. If we can all remember this bloodletting method and start the life-saving process immediately in a short time the victim will be revived and regain 100% normality. We hope you can tell others about this first aid method. By doing so stroke may be removed from the list of major causes of death. Forward this after reading. It will be a good deed indeed. As mentioned earlier in this article there are two types of acute stroke: ischemic and hemorrhagic. However there are also two kinds of strokes: acute and transient ischemic attack (TIA). The former is the sort that takes lives or leaves those it strikes with permanent and all too often heartbreakingly serious disabilities. With the latter the focal symptoms resolve within 24 hours leaving no permanent neurological deficit. With that in mind the miraculous recovery described in the e-mail above would have been due to the patient having weathered a TIA episode not to having had his blood drained from his fingers and ear lobes. Because the underlying patholophysiology is the same between acute stroke and TIA its important to seek immediate medical attention for all stroke victims. TIA is also often a warning sign heralding increased risk of stroke. (In high risk demographics the risk of stroke goes up ten-fold after a TIA.) As for not moving a stroke victim because so doing might cause irreparable bursting of the brain capillaries the initial insult (stroke) has already occurred so transport is unlikely to cause further harm. With regard to pricking fingers to get them bleeding as a possible counter to strokes according to Dr. Rupinder S. Sahsi of Guelph Ontario a medical doctor of our acquaintance I see no physiological reason why minute amounts of peripheral blood loss would have any effect on cerebral blood flow. In other words pricking a stroke victims fingers to get each of them to drip blood isnt going to do anything to aid that person. However taking the time to stab the victims fingers before bothering to transport him to a hospital with even that done at a low speed will cause harm because when it comes to obtaining proper treatment for stroke victims time lost is brain lost. Our physician friend counsels: Do not wait for the symptoms to resolve before taking a casual drive to the hospital in your vehicle as suggested by this e-mail. Getting a stroke victim to an emergency room in time for tPA therapy to be begun is the most important thing you can do to help prevent further brain damage. Do not waste any of that brief window of opportunity by driving at a snails pace or by stopping to stab the persons fingers and ear lobes.

While no one can deny the fact that Chicago is essentially a war zone the fact that a liberal city commissioner is planning to use United Nations peacekeepers to confront said violence should send shockwaves down the spine of any freedom-loving American. We are headed to the United Nations to meet with the assistant secretary general to talk about the violence in Chicago the gun violence in particular the bloodshed that is taking place in too many of our communities Boykin said at a press conference before the meeting. Boykin then went on to stunningly reveal that he is actually seeking to have the United Nations police the civilian population in Chicago. Im hoping to appeal to the UN to actually come to Chicago and meet with victims of violence and maybe even possibly help out in terms of peacekeeping efforts Boykin continued. After being asked by a reporter why he believes using UN troops to curb violence rather than actual American police would be a good idea Boykin revealed that he does indeed want the requested troops to essentially become the police in Chicago. They have been able to help in places like Africa where they have sent troops in sent forces in to help protect minority and vulnerable populations so frankly I think the same can be said for here in Chicago said Boykin. While so-called conspiracy theorists have long believed that globalist forces would eventually send United Nations troops to the streets of America we now have absolute 100% proof that this is indeed the plan. Liberal leaders in Chicago are now openly planning to declare martial law complete with UN shock troops on the streets to police the American population.

True RATING True ORIGIN On 26 January 2018 a Connecticut woman posted video to her Facebook page that was apparently video from a hidden camera showing California high school teacher Gregory Salcido talking pejoratively about the U.S. military: Flauto a family friend of the student who shot the footage asked Facebook friends to make this go viral and they heeded her request. The videos have been viewed millions of times and shared thousands of times. Salcidos comments captured headlines in local and national publications and were blasted by right-wing Salcido is both a long-time teacher at El Rancho High School and a city councilman in Pico Rivera a working-class city of roughly 63000 in southeast Los Angeles County. When we contacted him he declined to comment. In the videos which were secretly recorded by senior Victor Quinonez Salcidos comments were often met with students laughter. He criticizes military recruitment on the high schools campus and derides the glorification of the military saying statements made by United States President Donald Trump about the its greatness are overblown. In the quote that drew the most outrage Salcido said: We got all our freaking night vision goggles all that kind of stuff and we cant freaking control these dudes wearing freaking robes and chanclas. Because we got a bunch of dumb shits over there. Think about the people who you know who are over there your freaking stupid Uncle Louie or whoever theyre dumb shits. Theyre not like high-level thinkers theyre not academic people theyre not intellectual people. Theyre the freaking lowest of our low. Not morally. Im not saying they make bad moral decisions. Theyre not talented people. [] How come when you go to like the Rose Bowl Rose Parade Dodger opening day why after the national anthem do we have a killing machine fly over the freaking stadium? You know the stealth bombers out there and everyones like Yeah thats what we kill people with! Like why would that be something we celebrate? I dont get it. Anyway you better not freaking go. The comments drew a rather intense round of what has become a familiar pattern of viral Internet outrage and backlash. In response to the controversy Salcido has been officially admonished by the Pico Rivera City Council and stripped of his committee assignments. He has been placed on leave by the El Rancho Unified School District while the incident is under scrutiny. Even the United States Department of Defense has weighed in calling Salcidos comments uninformed. Salcido told the Los Angeles Times he was receiving vulgar and violent threats directed against himself and his family. Pico Rivera is a tight-knit primarily Latino suburb that has a strong tradition of honoring veterans and a large military-serving community with two Veterans of Foreign Wars posts and two American Legion auxiliaries said Mayor Gustavo Camacho. Speaking by phone Camacho told us: I respect the First Amendment and freedom of speech and Mr. Salcido is entitled to his freedom of speech. But I want to remind him that the reason he has that freedom is because of the men and women who lost their lives in order for us to have that freedom of speech. Many folks can listen to an audio and interpret it as they see fit. If you have an opinion about recruitment or a particular college recruiter why dont we tell our kids These are our options. I think this is a better option and let me help you get there rather than saying theyre dumb shits. I and my fellow council members strongly disagree with Mr. Salcidos statements and viewpoints. Frankly we denounce those statements. But Trinity College sociology professor and U.S. Army veteran Johnny Eric Williams said although Salcidos comments were delivered clumsily the teacher shouldnt be formally punished for making them calling the response troubling and overblown. Williams himself was the subject of a separate Internet outrage storm in June 2017 when a post on his personal Facebook page intended to criticize structural racism and white supremacy went viral after right-wing web sites interpreted it as racist toward white people. Williams who is African-American received death threats and told us that he continues to get them to this day. He added: The classroom is your social space where people can say things they wouldnt say normally out of the classroom setting so they can seriously interrogate it. It sounds like he was trying to provoke the kids to think about why a student would wear a Marines shirt without thinking about what the Marines do. Clearly it didnt come across well but its a classroom setting. Hes not doing a major speech hes trying to get kids to think about what the role of the military is. Its not simply to protect freedom as they say generically. The question is freedom to do what and whose freedoms? Thats the question that should be asked. Why would a kid record a teacher like that in the first place without him knowing? I think thats a level of cowardice and of unwillingness to participate that is unfathomable to me. It was done with malice. All education is about integrating people into what it means to be an American. One of the most important things is to be someone who questions who thinks critically and dissents. Thats the most patriotic thing someone can do. Williams told us that as a veteran he found Salcidos comments about the intelligence of service members to be unfounded and an excellent example of intellectual elitism: What happens is the U.S. military is the last option for folks in rural and poverty-stricken areas. Theres no other opportunity for them. But the idea that these folks are not smart I dont agree with that at all. Thats how I got through college. I had to do it because I didnt have money. Thats why you have a voluntary army because these people have nothing else they can do. Then they go and die while the kids with money go to college and dont even think about the fact that were in eternal war. Nevertheless Williams cautioned that lacking the freedom to criticize the military is akin to fascism. He added: At this historical moment in time people are more interested in how something is said rather than what is said and what it means. Quinonez told local news station KTLA he recorded Salcido because he wants to join the Marine Corps and was tired of the teachers negative commentary on the military. Pico Rivera is a thriving community with a growing economy but its no stranger to cut-throat politics and controversy and neither is Salcido. However much of the controversy in the citys past has been contained to the local level. In 2010 he ignited debate when he took the helm in the citys rotating mayoral position then removed a Bible from the Council chambers dais and put a halt to invocation saying it was unconstitutional. He was also placed on administrative leave by the school district that year after admonishing a student to be quiet by saying Shut up Kelly before I kill you. Salcido said at the time the comment was purposefully over-the-top and intended in jest. The childs parent Gerald Kelly said he was angry because Salcido was talking about marriage equality for LGBTQ people criticizing organized religion and (again) speaking critically of the military in class: This is the mayor and hes out here destroying these kids minds. Why allow him to lead this city when he stands for non-religious beliefs and that its OK to be against the Bible [says its OK to be] homosexual and defames people in the military? Salcido has clashed with his peers on the city council in the past as well often as their vocal critic amid allegations of public corruption. Although Salcido has faced widespread criticism for his remarks he has historically been a popular teacher with students. Some of his current and former students have come to his defense averring that the teacher also promised to fully support a student if he decided to join the military in spite of Salcidos discouragement. (This purported gesture of reassurance was not shown in the videos.) More generally students have described Salcido as real inspiring and loved. One of Salcidos current students a senior at El Rancho High School spoke to us anonymously. (We have verified the students identity.) That student described Salcido as a teacher who cares greatly about his students success but deliberately provokes debate in his classes and encourages his students to have deep conversations. The student also told us that Salcido sometimes has a very sarcastic sense of humor and sometimes it may be taken the wrong way but offered the opinion that the teacher was expressing his genuine beliefs in the video clips: Not a lot of teachers can keep their students captivated as much as he can. He really is one of a kind. He likes to get us thinking and he genuinely cares about what the students think Hes one of those guys that you would be happy to see every day and a person to always make you laugh. On 20 March 2018 the El Rancho Unified School District Board voted to terminate Salcidos employment as a teacher at El Rancho High School. As reported by the Whittier Daily News Salcido has one month in which he can appeal the decision during which time he will remain on unpaid leave.",,0,0,,

John McCain was absent It is a felony to offer money to a politician to influence acts like voting on a bill Rosie ODonnell sent out a flurry of tweets late Tuesday night offering Republican senators $2million in cash in exchange for a no vote on Trumps tax reform bill. So how about this I promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO the comedian desperately wrote on Twitter. NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER [super] RICH. No s*** 2 million cash each she wrote telling the lawmakers to send her a direct message on Twitter if they were interested in negotiating. The bribery didnt work though as Senate Republicans managed to push through the new tax bill by a narrow and last minute margin of 51-48. Its also a felony to offer money to a politician to influence acts such as voting on a bill -though ODonnell may not know that or may have meant the offer as a joke. About 10 minutes after the first tweet ODonnell wrote out another plea to Senator Collins in an attempt to appeal to Collins feminine side. Do u (sic) think your family is proud of u (sic) @sennatorcollins she tweeted again renewing the offer for $2million to the Maine Republican in exchange for a no vote. woman mother grandmother sister daughter u have betrayed us all she wrote. Dear god ask for forgiveness redeem ur (sic) soul tomorrow #NOTSEXIST. ODonnell also attached a photo of Senator Collins spending time with her family and celebrating her fathers 90th birthday. Collins seems not to have listened to Rosies pleas though that could be because the former co-host of The View used a misspelled twitter handle. Both Collins and Flake voted for the bill which has been roundly criticized as a major cut for the wealthy but an increase for the middle class. The bill was also passed by the House but representatives have to vote again Wednesday because of two provisions Senate said didnt comply with budget rules. The United States Senate just passed the biggest in history Tax Cut and Reform Bill Trump tweeted just after 1:00 in the morning. Terrible Individual Mandate (ObamaCare)Repealed. Goes to the House tomorrow morning for final vote. With a final House vote not expected until around lunchtime the White House announced that Trump would hold a bill passage event. The president will have to sign the bill later. House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted: Great news. The Senate just passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. After years of work we are going to enact the most sweeping pro-growth overhaul of our tax code in a generation. A wave of protesters provided one of the biggest bursts of emotion. One small group yelled out Kill the bill dont kill us! as the final vote was being taken. The Sergeant at Arms will restore order in the gallery said Vice President Mike Pence who was presiding over the chamber. Pences appearance was a flourish that put him in the spotlight though party leaders knew in advance his potential tie-breaking vote was not needed. One protester yelled at GOP Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona Have you no shame? Flake voted for the bill weeks after warning colleagues against complicity with Trump. Zero Senate democrats voted for the bill. Source: Daily Mail UK Featured Image: Getty Images Inset Image: WireImage,CLAIM A famous actor defended President Donald Trump and said that people who criticize the chief executive should leave the United States. False RATING False ORIGIN Several disreputable web sites have fabricated stories in 2017 claiming that various celebrities were rallying around President Donald Trump to the point of pushing their own versions of the love it or leave it argument. One variant of this falsehood began spreading in November 2017 when various sites published versions of the hoax centering on actor Bruce Willis. At least two of these sites USA Updated Daily News and World Wide Politics even replicated the same centered text layout and picture of Willis wearing a Trump wig and a red Make America Great Again baseball cap: These articles also featured the very same copy including this made-up quote: Before every election so far there were debates and fighting between candidates. But once we had a winner everybody just stood behind the elected President. Now we see that the fighting and conflict continue long after the 2016 election. I dont like that. It doesnt look good. If you dont like him go to Canada or something. The image accompanying these article was taken from an October 2015 appearance by the Die Hard star on the late night Jimmy Fallon-hosted Tonight Show (which took place over a year before Trump was actually elected). However rather than fawning over President Trump (who wasnt yet president) during that appearance Willis merely confessed that his Trumpian wig was in fact his real hair: It suddenly has just seemed to grow exponentially and I was a blonde when I was a kid. The bogus post circulated online about a month after similarly shoddy web sites posted fabricated stories claiming that Sandra Bullock had encouraged anyone criticizing Trump (but especially Hillary Clinton) to leave the U.S. Another (similarly untrue) variant of these stories published on 17 November 2017 was based on the idea that actress Jennifer Aniston wanted to start a Celebrities for Trump group.,,0,0,,

He was 67. Cassidy the child of two actors was born on 12 April 1950 in New York City beginning his acting career in earnest when he was 18. He is best known for his role as Keith Partridge on the enormously popular musical sitcom The Partridge Family which started its run in 1970 and became a pop-culture touchstone that outlasted the shows 1974 cancellation by decades and spawned at least one megahit I Think I Love You: His character on The Partridge Family (along with his talent and androgynous good looks) made him so popular that the term Cassidymania was created to showcase his immense popularity. However his popularity led to tragedy on at least one occasion. In 1974 thousands of excited concertgoers crowded Londons White City Stadium resulting in a crush that led to hundreds of fans being overcome and injured and leading to the death of one 14-year-old girl Bernadette Whelan who suffered a heart attack and later died at a hospital. Cassidy then announced he would withdraw from the pop-star stage at age 24. Despite this early retirement Cassidy soon returned to performing working as an actor on stage and in television while putting out a series of pop music hits including 1990s Lyin to Myself: Cassidy announced in February 2017 that he had been diagnosed with dementia. His family announced on 18 November 2017 that he had been hospitalized in critical condition with organ failure.,,0,0,,

163,http://kroger-2017.life/,https://www.snopes.com/inboxer/nothing/krogercard.asp,2014-10-15,2000.0,attribution-false,,CLAIM The Black Panther Party created the Women Infants and Children (WIC) program that provides supplemental food assistance to single mothers and their children. Mostly False RATING Mostly False ORIGIN The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women Infants and Children (known as WIC for short) a federal program that provides nutritional assistance to malnourished mothers and children was enacted in 1972 as an amendment to the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. Initially funded as a two-year pilot program WIC was permanently reauthorized by Congress in 1975 and today offers federal grants to states for supplemental foods health care referrals and nutrition education for low-income pregnant breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding postpartum women and to infants and children up to age five who are found to be at nutritional risk. The program is administrated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Impetus for the legislation is usually credited to an accumulating body of research in the 1960s identifying hunger and malnutrition as a major national problem. A 1969 report by the White House Conference on Food Nutrition and Health concluded that hunger and poverty existed on a disgraceful scale across the United States and urged the federal government to take immediate action to close the hunger gap among poorer Americans. After some pilot programs launched by the Nixon administration failed to produce the desired results a bill containing the WIC amendment and improvements to existing school nutrition programs was passed by Congress in 1972. There is an alternative account of how WIC came about however. According to this narrative the program grew out of (or was at least inspired by) organized efforts by the Black Panther Party (BPP) to help feed single mothers and their children in predominantly African-American communities in the late 1960s. Here it is in meme form as posted in February 2017 recognition of Black History Month: One also finds the claim repeated on web sites such as Counter Current News and Urban Intellectuals who cite as evidence a list of 65 community programs allegedly created by the Black Panthers during their heyday including a WIC (Women Infants and Children) Program. But though its easily corroborated that the Panthers launched a community food program in 1968 called Free Breakfast for Children an effort some believe provided inspiration for the federal governments school breakfast program (if not for WIC itself) we could find no evidence that the Panthers ever operated a program called WIC or which bore any close resemblance to the USDA program. The roll-out of the Free Breakfast for Children program marked a turning point however short-lived in the Black Panthers public image. From its inception as an armed revolutionary organization in 1966 (J. Edgar Hoover called BPP the greatest threat to the internal security of the country) press coverage of the Panthers was overwhelmingly negative focusing exclusively on their militant rhetoric and violent confrontations with police. The breakfast program provided the opportunity to show a kinder gentler side of the party albeit still fraught with revolutionary politics. The New York Times reported in June 1969: In the Bay Area every chapter of the Black Panther Party is involved in providing free breakfasts for children. The project involves at least six cities in the state. Right now Bobby Seale chairman and co-founder of the party said last week we are feeding over 1000 kids every day right here in the Bay Area. Seale added that the program which was also operating in New York Chicago Detroit Boston Los Angeles Kansas City and other major cities feeds 10000 children daily. [] In addition to what they can collect at the rallies and demonstrations the Panthers also make the rounds of business establishments in the area. Their demand that merchants doing business in the black communities make contributions is firm. One large supermarket Safeway is now the target of a Panther-led boycott because according to Seale it refused to contribute $100 a week to the breakfast program. While the Panthers say that the program was initiated to feed hungry children they make no effort to mask its political side. Most of the church basements and halls where the breakfasts are served have huge posters and pictures of Black Panther leaders and heroes of the black nationalist movement pasted on the walls. The Free Huey shouts are almost constant. Free Huey is a Panther slogan that refers to Huey Newton one of the founders of the organization and its minister of defense who was jailed last year after a manslaughter conviction arising from the fatal shooting of an Oakland policeman. That it was partly a public relations effort doesnt change the fact that the Panthers were providing a sorely needed service to impoverished children which could very well have provided the impetus for the federal government to step in. There is no doubt moreover that members of Congress charged with solving Americas hunger problem were aware of the free breakfast program. Testifying before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs in May 1969 California legislator Jesse Unruh said The Black Panthers are supplying more free breakfasts to California school children than the federal government does. It was intended (and no doubt heard) as a wake-up call. Still its hard to make the case that the Panthers program served as an exact prototype for Sen. Hubert Humphreys WIC legislation which was still three years away from being introduced in Congress. There were few real similarities between the programs. Although the Panthers launched other initiatives (including free medical clinics) to help people in various communities the free breakfasts were for children alone. As its name implies the federal governments Special Supplemental Food Program for Women Infants and Children was much broader in scope. Plus it had nothing to do with serving breakfast. There was a separate USDA program for that. The federal School Breakfast Program was established under the Child Nutrition Act in 1966 and it had already been in operation for three years by the time the Black Panther Party instituted its community-based programs. Thats not to say that school breakfasts were an unqualified success however. Partly because it met with political resistance and funding constraints it took years for the federal program to ramp up to the point where it even came close to meeting the needs of the population it was meant to help. The Panthers helped expose the many shortcomings of that and other government food assistance programs. Historian Susan Levine author of School Lunch Politics: The Surprising History of Americas Favorite Welfare Program gives the Panthers their due in that regard but noted in an interview with Eater.com that lobbying groups such as the Committee on School Lunch Participation likely had a greater effect on federal policy: The Panthers were part of the general context in the late 1960s Levine says. But I think CSLP was probably more specifically influential because they actually went to Congress and testified and their report got a lot of attention in the wake of Martin Luther King Jr.s death. It is a fact in any case that the number of meals served to children in the federal school breakfast program quadrupled between 1968 and 1972. Its not implausible to suppose that the Black Panthers Free Breakfast for Children program played at least an inspirational role in that effort.,,0,0,,

Please check back later!,PUNXSUTAWNEY Pa. (AP) Pennsylvanias most famous groundhog foresees no early end to winter. The handlers of Punxsutawney Phil said the furry rodent has called for six more weeks of winter after seeing his shadow at dawn Friday. The top hat-wearing members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Clubs Inner Circle reveal Phils forecast every Feb. 2. It is based on a German legend surrounding Candlemas. The legend says if a furry rodent casts a shadow that day winter continues. If not spring comes early. In reality Phils prediction is decided ahead of time by the group on Gobblers Knob a tiny hill just outside Punxsutawney about 65 miles (about 100 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. Thousands of people gathered overnight to await the forecast bundled up against the cold and entertained by folk music and a fireworks display with temperatures around 11 degrees (minus-12 Celsius). The groundhogs prediction is typically contained in a short poem. Up early this morning. Far from home. Are you searching for the Phil-osophers stone? Well even my best friends they dont know. Is it an early spring or just more snow the proclamation read. My faithful followers your hands (and my paws) are getting cold so here is my forecast. Not lead but solid gold: I see my royal Shadow! Six more weeks of Winter to go! Records dating to 1887 show Phil has now predicted more winter 103 times while forecasting an early spring just 18 times including last year. There are no records for the remaining years.,,0,0,,

False RATING False ORIGIN On 3 January 2018 the web site Americas Last Line of Defense published an article reporting that a Muslim waitress had refused to seat a church group at a restaurant claiming religious freedom allowed her to do so: The meaning of religious freedom has been repeatedly perverted by liberal perverts over the years but Muslim waitress Sallah al-Sallah took things farther than usual when she used it to take away the rights of 27 Christians many of whom were children. The St. Pleasant Allegorical Church of the Divine decided to do something nice for the people in the choir and take them out to dinner at the Waffle House in Arnbur Michigan but their fun evening took a horrible turn when they met al-Sallah. The church group had called ahead to let the restaurant know they had a large party but when they arrived they told Sallah their group name and she instantly became combative according to Pastor Joe Friedrichs. She told us she couldnt seat us Friedrichs told the Arnbur Explorer in an interview published the day after the incident. She said that she was forbidden by her holy book to feed infidels like us and that she could not take part in our meal in any way even by seating us Friedrichs explained adding that the group asked if another employee could help them. al-Sallah told them the restaurant was shorthanded. Nothing about this report was true. No church named the St. Pleasant Allegorical Church of the Divine nor a publication known as the Arnbur Explorer exists and the photograph of the waitress that accompanied the article was lifted from a several-month-old piece by an anti-Islam web site about a restaurant customer who refused to be waited on by a Muslim server wearing a headscarf.

The young girl just 16-years-old when she was seduced by Schumer committed suicide before her 20th birthday. Schumers daughter Lisa first broke the story because she thought her dad was being a hypocrite about the Roy Moore scandal. Schumer has been one of the most vocal opponents of Judge Moores Senate run on the grounds of some fantasy tale told by a woman who were expected to believe can remember details from 1977 like it was yesterday even though she managed to forget for 40 years. What will end up being the nail in Schumers coffin is the report from Planned Parenthood showing that Schumer paid for not one but two abortions and was the responsible party who picked the girl up from the murder clinic when she was done. Schumers own wife Kaitlyn paid the girls mother nearly $2 million to go away. Until now she was happy to stay in the shadows: Now that the story is public and my daughter isnt the one who did wrong I can finally grieve and she can finally rest. Schumer might want to consider paying her a little bit more money before she opens up completely. He is expected to resign over the allegations as soon as Congress returns from Christmas break.,CLAIM A rare confluence of celestial events will bring what NASA terms a super blue blood moon to the skies on 31 January 2018. True RATING True ORIGIN On 31 January 2018 the final installment of what National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has billed as a supermoon trilogy will grace our skies. If an events impact is measured solely by its lack of statistical probability this one is to be a doozy. Supermoons which have most recently occurred on 3 December 2017 and 1 January 2018 are full moons that happen to occur when the Earth and the moon are at or near the closest positions in their orbit (an event called a perigee) making the moon appear about 14% larger and up to 30% brighter. Every two and a half years on average two full moons appear in the same calendar month. Despite the fact that this phenomenon changes nothing about the moons physical appearance the second moon is sometimes referred to as a blue moon. Since 1 January was also a full moon that will make the supermoon on 31 January 2018 both a blue moon and a supermoon. Capping all of these coincidences is the fact that Wednesdays super blue moon will also occur during a total lunar eclipse. Lunar eclipses occur when Earth passes in between the sun and the moon casting a shadow on the moon causing whats referred to as a blood moon when the moon is full. Unlike a blue moon a blood moon actually does alter the color of the moon to a moody red; without the reflection of direct sunlight we usually see on the Moon the only light that reflects back to us are the distorted reds that have passed through Earths atmosphere. The confluence of these events have led NASA and media outlets to bill the full moon of 31 January 2018 as a super blue blood moon. The best time to see it depends on your location according to NASA: If you live in North America Alaska or Hawaii the eclipse will be visible before sunrise on Jan. 31. For those in the Middle East Asia eastern Russia Australia and New Zealand the super blue blood moon can be seen during moonrise in the evening of the 31st. For those unable to view the statistical anomaly on their own NASA will offer a live feed of the event starting at 5:30 am EST on 31 January 2018. The next time a supermoon and a lunar eclipse will occur simultaneously (ignoring the blue moon part of the trifecta) will be on 21 January 2019. Avid readers and lunar fans may recall that a 27 September 2015 supermoon and lunar eclipse combination was billed by NASA at the time as the last such event until 2033. The reason for this apparent discrepancy has to do with the fluid label of supermoon for which there is no formal scientific definition. The relative superness of a full moon depends on how close it occurs to the perigee the specific instant in time that the moon and Earth are closest to each other. The lunar eclipse/full moon this week will actually occur many hours after this event which will happen at 10:56 am EST the morning of January 30th. In the case of the 27 September 2015 event the perigee between Earth and the moon occurred within two hours of the eclipse making it more super than this one. Ambiguity of the term supermoon aside the claim that there will be a slightly closer full moon during a lunar eclipse that happens to be the second full moon of the month on Wednesday 31 January 2018 is true.,,0,0,,

Mixture RATING Mixture WHATS TRUE A UK man was arrested and charged with ""racially or religiously aggravated assault"" for kicking a Muslim woman in the stomach and killing her unborn twins. WHATS FALSE The suspect was a non-U.S. citizen whose political affiliations are not known and photograph often circulated with this story was taken from an unrelated event. ORIGIN On 8 February 2017 the web site Alternative Media Syndicate published an article reporting that a Trump supporter had kicked a pregnant Muslim woman in the stomach killing her two unborn twins: Trump Supporter Kicked Pregnant Muslim Woman In Stomach Killing Unborn Twins A MAN was charged today charged over a race attack on a pregnant woman who later lost her unborn twin babies. David Gallacher 37 is accused of assaulting the mum-to-be by kicking her in the stomach as she walked close to a mosque. That article was based on a real incident which took place in August 2016 in England. The Thames Police Department took to Facebook to state that David Gallacher had been charged with a number of offenses stemming from that incident (and another which took place a month later) including assault racially/religiously aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer: We have charged a man with a number of offences including assault racially/religiously aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer in Bletchley. David Gallacher aged 37 of no fixed abode was charged with one count of assault causing ABH one count of assault by beating two counts of racially/religiously aggravated assault and three counts of assaulting a constable in the execution of his/her duty. The charges relate to two incidents. The first was on Saturday 6 August 2016 when two victims a 34-year-old woman and a 40-year-old man were assaulted and racially abused by a man near the Co-op on Water Eaton Road Bletchley. The second incident relates to an incident on 14 September 2016 in Larch Grove Bletchley when three police officers were assaulted as they arrested a man. Shortly after the charges were announced Metro published an article on the topic and noted that the female victim in the August 2016 assault was a Somali Muslim and had been pregnant with twins at the time of the attack: A man has been charged with racially aggravated assault after a Muslim woman was kicked in the stomach while pregnant with twins causing her to lose the babies. David Gallacher 37 was charged with one count of actual bodily harm two of racially or religiously aggravated assault assaulting tree police officers and one count of common assault. A Somali woman was kicked in the stomach while pregnant but did not know she was expecting twins until she was told she had lost them. Similar reports were filed by BBC the Independent and the International Business Times. None of these publications identified the accused as a Trump supporter and as this incident occurred in the United Kingdom its unlikely that Gallacher had any substantive ties to American politics. Alternative Media Syndicate claimed that Gallacher expressed support for President Trump on his social media pages but did not provide any evidence (such as links to his profiles or screenshots of his timeline) documenting this assertion nor the suggestion that Gallachers putative political preferences had anything to do with the motivation behind his actions. Furthermore the image displayed above does not show the woman who was reportedly attacked by Gallacher. That photograph has been online since at least 2012 and Alternative Media Syndicate noted at the bottom of their article that it was taken from similar incident in France for illustrative purposes.",,0,0,,

The court ruled 5-4 with Justice Gorsuch casting the tie-breaker that the only Islam taught to our children in public schools will be the history of Radical Islam and what they can do to help stop it. Judge Gorsuch in his first opinion for the high court wrote: The government certainly has no business being involved in religion but this isnt a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the Judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion. We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity as our founders wanted and we certainly shouldnt be filling the children with lies about Islam being a religion of peace when they see the carnage on the news almost every day. It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated. There was no truth to this story which originated with the clickbait fake news site Americas Last Line of Defense and was widely spread online by a network of shill sites.

The college is seeking to evict Palmer and collect back rent maintaining she has been illegally squatting in her dorm room. According to the lawsuit Palmer was denied summer housing in 2016 but remained in her dorm even after the school sent her several notices stating that she would be charged $150 a day if she stayed and issued her a 30-day eviction notice in September 2017. According to the lawsuit the 32-year-old Palmer failed to pay her student fees almost immediately after moving into her dormitory apartment at Brookdale Residence Hall on E. 25th St. in Spring 2016 and by July had received notices to vacate on account of her failure to pay fees or enroll in courses: Not only did Palmer refuse to vacate her dormitory room in order to make room for incoming eligible students enrolled at Hunter College but she dropped out of Hunter College making her ineligible for student housing in any event. In an interview with WCBS Palmer a geography major said she had been forced out of classes in her final semester and plans to stay in the dorm and finish her degree: I feel like every semester is a new opportunity to register for courses she said. I think I should just stay and fight the case. Palmer claims the school forced her out of classes a semester before graduating when she couldnt pay her bills.

True RATING True ORIGIN On 28 February 2018 the Associated Press published photographs showing people wearing brightly colored robes and crowns (some of which appeared to have been crafted from bullets) carrying AR-15 firearms in what was termed a commitment ceremony. The surreal scene showcased in the photographs prompted readers to inquire whether it was actually real: Worshippers clutching AR-15 rifles and some wearing bullet crowns participated in a commitment ceremony today at World Peace and Unification Sanctuary in Newfoundland Pa. The event led a nearby school to cancel classes for the day. Photos @jacquelinelarma pic.twitter.com/GXzrZeK41z AP Images (@AP_Images) February 28 2018 The AP is a legitimate news agency and as reality is sometimes much stranger than fiction this story and these photographs are authentic. They show roughly 600 members of the World Peace and Unification Sanctuary church in Newfoundland Pennsylvania considered by some to be a cult. The sect has undergone some rebranding since its heyday but it is not new. It is an offshoot of the notorious Unification Church perhaps best known for its adherents who are sometimes colloquially called Moonies after its late founder Rev. Sun Myung Moon described by RationalWiki as a nutjob from South Korea who claimed he was the Second Coming of Jesus. His son Rev. Sean Moon oversees the Newfoundland congregation; his other son Justin Moon owns a gun manufacturing business which sponsored the event as reported by the Standard-Speaker: Moon who refers to himself as the Second King and anointed heir to the True Father urges followers to arm themselves to defend their families their communities and the nation of Cheon Il Guk the kingdom of God the church believes is prophesied in biblical Scripture. Through its Rod of Iron Ministries affiliate the church also was among the sponsors for a pro-gun-rights President Trump Thank You Dinner this past Saturday in Matamoras Pike County. Kahr Arms a gun manufacturing company based in Greeley Pike County and owned by Moons brother also was a sponsor of that event. The photographs were taken at a ceremony in which couples were asked to bring their rods of iron a phrase from the apocalyptic Book of Revelation in the New Testament that Moon has interpreted rather specifically to mean AR-15s. The Philadelphia Inquirer had still more about the event: The ceremonys official name was the Cosmic True Parents of Heaven Earth and Humanity Cheon Il Guk Book of Life Registration Blessing. It was part of the churchs weeklong Festival of Grace which included a President Trump Thank You Dinner on Saturday. Wednesdays church ceremony garnered international attention because of the call for couples to bring AR-15s a popular semi-automatic rifle that has been used in many of the nations worst mass shootings including the Valentines Day massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.

False RATING False ORIGIN Two of the favorite targets of disreputable right-wing web sites are the Black Lives Matter movement and the mainstream liberal news media. In February 2018 the MediaConservative.com web site republished a fabricated story that ticked both those boxes. The story attacked a purportedly prominent member of Black Lives Matter named Marquesha Johnson accusing her of organizing over 900 events and gather[ing] millions of dollars in donations to escape homelessness and purchase a million-dollar home with donations solicited to help the social justice movement. MediaConservative wrote: In fact the donations [Johnson] collected helped only herself to rise in society. A class action lawsuit stated that Johnson had solicited donations from vulnerable people to help others but instead used it to help herself. According to the document the Black Lives Matter leading figure purchased a $1.2 million home for herself. But this is not all instead of using the donations to help people she also bought herself a brand new Range rover as well as some other exorbitancies. The post rehashes a story originally published in November 2017 by the satirical web site ReaganWasRight.com which falsely reported: Unfortunately its likely that what she did was perfectly legal because she solicited the funds through a GoFundMe campaign and the company is notoriously bad at working with police to crack down on scammers. Johnson was questioned by police but denies misusing funds. She refuses to hand over records. We found no evidence that corroborates any of these claims which were also circulated on the ConservativeStand.com web site. The ReaganWasRight.com article linked to a federal court records database but there is no record there of any lawsuit against a Marquesha Johnson. In fact we could find no evidence of a leading Black Lives Matter campaigner of that name. The image used in all three articles does not show Marquesha Johnson and her $1.2 million home. In fact it is a composite of a police photograph of Temitope Adebamiro a Delaware woman sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 for stabbing her husband to death and a photograph of Las Ventanas Al Paraiso a resort in Los Cabos Mexico owned by the billionaire Ty Warner. In other words the story and the accompanying photo are both outright fabrications.

True RATING True ORIGIN In late February 2018 news stories reported that Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson spent $31000 on a dining set for his office and billed it to the federal agency just as the the Trump administration was planning to cut HUDs budget. Readers who saw these details discussed on social media asked if it was true and it is. The story has been vetted and reported by legitimate news sources. The New York Times reported on 27 February 2018: Department officials did not request approval from the House or Senate Appropriations Committees for the expenditure of $31561 even though federal law requires congressional approval to furnish or redecorate the office of a department head if the cost exceeds $5000. HUD spokesman Raffi Williams told the Times that at that time Carson had no intention of returning the dining set and didnt think the cost was too steep (even though many Americans earn less in a year than the price of the items). In May 2017 Carson was criticized for comments in which he expressed his opinion that low income people receiving housing assistance should not be made too comfortable. According to The Guardian former top HUD official Helen Foster filed a complaint with a federal watchdog agency saying that she had been demoted and transferred in retaliation for resisting the expensive redecoration effort by Carson and his staff even though it violated the law: Helen Foster said she was told $5000 will not even buy a decent chair after informing her bosses this was the legal price limit for improvements to the HUD secretarys suite at the departments Washington headquarters. Foster 47 claimed that she also faced retaliation for exposing a $10m budget shortfall and for protesting when she was barred from handling a pair of sensitive freedom of information act (FOIA) requests relating to Trump apparently because she was perceived to be a Democrat. By 1 March 2018 Carson responded to the controversy by notifying CNN that he had changed course and wanted to cancel the purchase: I was as surprised as anyone to find out that a $31000 dining set had been ordered Carson said in the statement. I have requested that the order be canceled. We will find another solution for the furniture replacement. Carson also said his wife Candy Carson had asked if used furniture was an option the first time theres been an indication that she was involved in the process. My wife also looked at catalogs and wanted to be sure that the color of the chair fabric of any set that was chosen matched the rest of the decor he wrote.

Jesus Ramon Sanchez from the Little Havana neighborhood in Miami was allegedly attempting to engage in sexual intercourse with a 4-year old male pit bull when the dog defended itself by tearing off the mans genitals with its teeth. The incident took place around 8:30 this morning in the Allen Morris Dog Park in Miami. According to witnesses 4-year old Spanky was playing with his owner in the park when Mister Sanchez grabbed him and attempted to rape him. The male pit bull violently resisted and severely injured its attackers legs arms and groin. According to its owner this is the first time that Spanky has ever bitten anyone and he acted strictly out of self-defense. The dog was just running around playing with a ball when the man came out of nowhere and tried to grab it says Dorothy Steinberg a witness of the events. The man had his pants down and was struggling with the dog. Everyone in the park was just stunned and nobody did anything but the dog defended itself and bit back. In a matter of seconds he grabbed the mans genitals with its teeth and literally tore them apart. And this is not the 1st case below its video from last October .,CLAIM U.S. President George Washington had wooden teeth. False RATING False ORIGIN One of the most popular historical exhibits at Mount Vernon originally the estate of the first President of the United States and now a monument to his life and legacy is a set of the great mans dentures. The crude handmade prosthesis comprising both upper and lower teeth is displayed in a circular glass case permitting a 360-degree view. The majority of Mount Vernons one million visitors per year one presumes pause to stare at the famous choppers for at least a moment before moving on to the table settings. The fascination with George Washingtons false teeth could be attributable to various factors that theyre a medical curiosity from the 18th century when dentistry was still just this side of barbaric; that theyre an intimate vestige of the man himself letting us feel closer to him; or maybe that were all just eager to see if the scuttlebutt we heard and repeated as kids is true: that the Father of Our Country had wooden teeth. The exhibit does not disappoint. One look at the contraption itself which is actually made out of metal ivory and real teeth (both animal and human) is enough to see that it wasnt carved out of wood: Photo credit: Elyssa Young/snopes.com Plus theres a plaque that lays out the facts in black and white: Dentures Worn by George Washington Lead base fitted with cow and human teeth elephant ivory brass and steel. ca. 1775-1799. Although George Washington brushed his teeth regularly by the time he took the oath of office as president at age 57 he was wearing full dentures. Contrary to popular myth Washingtons false teeth were not made of wood but of human and cow teeth as well as elephant ivory. The dentures required frequent adjusting to function naturally and Washington repeatedly sent them to John Greenwood his dentist in New York City for repairs. As was common at the time the dentures were ill-fitting awkward and sometimes painful. They distorted Washingtons appearance mainly by making his lower lip protrude as can be seen in contemporaneous portraiture of the first president. According to historian Michael Beschloss his teeth were an embarrassment to him: He once pleaded with his dentist John Greenwood by letter to avoid any change to the denture which will in the least degree force the lips out more than now do as it does this too much already. Members of his cabinet sadly noted how rarely the tight-lipped president smiled or laughed. Others insisted that his embarrassment about his dentures which sometimes caused him to hiss as he spoke made him reclusive. Washington was plagued by dental problems throughout most of his adult life. He attributed the misfortune to cracking of walnuts in his youth his friend John Adams wrote though heredity must have played a part as well. Bad hygiene too though Washington wouldnt have been entirely to blame. Its not that George Washington was sloppy about dental hygiene John L. Smith notes in Journal of the American Revolution its just that dental hygiene was practically non-existent in the late eighteenth century: In fact in some social groups taking care of your teeth was even considered effeminate or vain. But Washington was very wise about the message an image can send and knew that in the Continental Congress and as commander-in-chief and president he had to look the part of a leader which meant at least having teeth. Aside from the possible constant pain Washington endured from his bad teeth he stayed on a constant life quest to (simply said) have teeth in his mouth. And he paid a lot for professional dental care all through his lifetime. George Washington wore several different sets of dentures over the course of his lifetime none made of wood. Instead the dentists treating him would have used the cutting-edge materials of the time: bone ivory lead brass gold and the castaway teeth of horses donkeys cows and yes human beings. Washington is said to have saved his own extracted teeth for future use in dentures. A longstanding rumor that Washington purchased teeth from his slaves may be true as well Michael Beschloss writes: According to his account books in 1784 emulating some of his affluent friends he bought nine teeth from unidentified Negroes perhaps enslaved African Americans at his beloved Mount Vernon; the price was 122 shillings. As to how and why the rumor of Washingtons wooden teeth took hold in the first place no one knows for sure but there are two main theories both based on the assumption that his dentures must have looked like they were made of wood. One holds that they turned mottled and brown with age the other that their woodiness was due to Washingtons habit of drinking fortified wine: Ivory and bone both have hairline fractures in them which normally cant be seen. With Washingtons fondness for Madeira wine a very dark wine over time the darkness of the wine started to darken the false teeth of the dentures. Then the thin fractures in the bone started to darken even more than the rest of the tooth making the lines look like the grain in a piece of wood that misled later observers. Two hundred fifty years later were still talking about Washingtons wooden teeth. Like the cherry tree he never chopped down as a child they are forever enshrined in American legend.,,0,0,,

If they do not respect our president elect and our country!!,CLAIM President Trump said that a number of state laws allow a baby to be born from his or her mothers womb in the ninth month. True RATING True ORIGIN On 19 January 2018 President Trump broadcast an address from the White House Rose Garden in conjunction with the pro-life group March for Lifes 45th annual rally. Lending his support to that movement (even though he was once squarely on the opposite site of that issue) the president told the audience that he was committed to building a society where life is celebrated protected and cherished. The president raised some eyebrows however when he proclaimed that Right now a number of state laws allow a baby to be born from his or her mothers womb in the ninth month. It is wrong. It has to change: That remark quickly became the subject of mocking social media memes: Trumps statement was eyebrow-raising because the ninth month is when one typically expects a child to be born (the average human gestation period being 280 days). Of course President Trump likely simply misspoke and said born rather than torn intending for his statement to decry late-term abortions as he did elsewhere in his address when he voiced support for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act saying: I strongly supported the House of Representatives pain-capable bill which would end painful late-term abortions nationwide and I call upon the Senate to pass this important law and send it to my desk for signing. Trump similarly condemned rip[ping] the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby during the 2016 presidential debates:,,0,0,,

She says the rest of the signature belonged to Moore. Moore has denied signing the yearbook and said he did not know Nelson at the time. Several women have come forward and accused Moore of pursuing romantic relationships with them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s a couple others have accused him of assault. He has denied the allegations. More than a dozen Senate Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have called on Moore to drop out of the race. The campaign arm for Senate Republicans and the Republican National Committee have also severed ties with Moore.,,,0,0,,

Anger is growing among U.S Citizens. They are outraged by the recent exposure of the consequences of Muslim immigration. Because as it turns out they have to pay a fortune in social assistance to Syrian immigrants that are living in the United States. We have many cases in Europe too! In Denmark where a Syrian man with 3 wives and 20 kids gets DKK 214000 in child benefits which caused outrage in Denmark and proposals for changing the law. Ghazia A. (49) was a self-employed cars salesman in Syria where he provided for himself and his large family. But in 2015 he traveled to Germany and that was the end of self- sustaining. In Germany he does not lift a finger. He lives on social welfare paid by German taxpayers. And he does so with his four wives and 22 children. He also has an adult daughter who is married in Saudi Arabia. So it would be interesting to see how much he would earn if he was in the USA and we all know how many cases of Muslims coming into our country and living on welfare! A U.S. economist has calculated how much this family would take from the U.S. Treasury. He reached a figure that it is about $ 360000 a year. Yet vets struggle every day. Not to mention hard working people who live payday to payday. That figure has led many Americans to see red at the fact that they are the ones who must pay the large sum. Money to healthy adults who do not work and even undermines American values with polygamy. In Muslim countries a man is usually allowed to have up to four wives. Ghazia A. is one of the many Muslim men who has used this right in Syria. In the United States and most of the western countries however polygamy is prohibited. But immigration means that there is a growing number of Muslims in the United States who practice polygamy. Ghazia A. admittedly was asked to make one of the four wives his official wife and he chose Twasif with five children as his official wife. The three other women now live three other places with the other 17 children. But in reality his polygamy remains largely unchanged ! Authorities have designated the three other wives as his partners. They also live nearby.,,,0,0,,

The Rosie ODonnell Show The Queen Of Nice Wow! What happened? Now she appears to be a bitter and twisted malcontent dripping with anti-Trump leftist political rantings and conspiracy theories. Its difficult to decide whether Rosies downfall is a sad reflection of her torrid life choices or a hilarious spectacle for news grabbing headlines. Either way here she is caught in a war of words over her illegal offer to bribe Republican senators. And of course she speaks from the gutter. This from The Federalist Papers So really it should come as no surprise that 2017 Rosie would see nothing wrong with openly attempting to bribe elected lawmakers to vote the way she wants but the spectacle is hilarious all the same. At the Daily Wire Ben Shapiro collects ODonnells tweets and the relevant federal statutes shes flagrantly violating: susan 2 million dollars cash call if u want to negotiate do u think your family is proud of u @sennatorcollins woman mother grandmother sister daughter u have betrayed us all dear god ask for forgiveness redeem ur soul tomorrow #NOTSEXIST pic.twitter.com/wa0QcMXNk2 ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 I think the most surprising thing about this story isnt that ODonnell is so open about corruption again weve known she was a raving lunatic for years but that she supposedly has $4 million cash on hand with which to buy off politicians. I mean she hasnt exactly been A-list for quite a while And make no mistake this is illegal as all get-out according to 18 USC 201(b): Whoever (1)directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity with intent (A) to influence any official act; or (B) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing or collude in or allow any fraud or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud on the United States; or (C) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person; shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value whichever is greater or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years or both and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor trust or profit under the United States. Not a lot of gray area in there.

Dont be a homophobic sexual harasser too. https://t.co/U4cEM8Hhg0 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) December 20 2017 Because concepts like coherence and logic are lost on Rosie heres apparently the best she could muster in retaliation: Do you think Rosie knows Shapiro was a NeverTrumper?) Because even she knows she cant make a positive case for bribing senators ODonnell has apparently settled on the I was just kidding defense if her retweets of followers like this are indicative: The dear @Rosie makes a joke about bribing the @GOP to make a point and the Alt-reich goes bat shit crazy. Its like they dont have humor in Russia. Pesach Pace Lattin (@pacelattin) December 20 2017 This is kind of the perfect way to close out the insane year that has been 2017.

Mary Lynne Davies who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines. The revelation came after the yearbook inscription that Moore supposedly wrote in the 1970s turned out to be a forgery. Davies who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. Her attorney says she sticks by her story: My clients main concern is that because of the yearbook thing nobody will believe her story.

Nothing about this is wrong jerk. Justice Moore is a fine upstanding man who has shown time and time again that he loves America and our family values. He deserves to be exonerated. The AG says hes also looking into charges against the other Moore accusers as well as the employees of that mall that said he was a pedophile.

Under Obamas lead schools were teaching that Islam is a peaceful religion even though all of our real life examples contradict that. Treddify reported that Judge Neil Gorsuch cast the tie-breaking vote. The 5-4 ruling was that the only part of Islam history taught in public schools will be Radical Islam and what students can do to help stop it. Judge Gorsuch wrote The government certainly has no business being involved in religion but this isnt a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion. We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity as our founders wanted and we certainly shouldnt be filling the children with lies about Islam being a religion of peace when they see the carnage on the news almost every day. Gorsuch continued It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated. This is an additional ruling from the one just last week that forbids the teaching of Islamic tenets or Sharia as part of world history as well. The Obama administration obviously has no power or influence in the court anymore. Our country and Christianity scored a huge win. Thanks to our president we can get back to respecting our true values and the normal every day worshipping of the only real God. H/T Makeamerica,,,0,0,,

During an interview with ABC News Nelson made the bombshell admission which was immediately glossed over by the mainstream media reporter who acted as if her admitting she forged at least part of the yearbook was no big deal. As Breitbart reported In yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription. Worse still the reporter actually coaches Nelson puts words in her mouth downplay the enormous significance of her deceit. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 The ABC News reporter in a pathetic attempt at pretending what he was about to say wasnt huge news quickly revealed Nelsons deceit before pretending it wasnt deceitful at all. Make no mistake this is the mainstream media openly covering for a women they are trying to use to take out an anti-establishment Republican. Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription the ABC News reporter reveals. But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbook ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence the Breitbart report continued. This is about as transparent as it gets. ABC News attempted to have Nelson reveal the stunning fact that she forged part of the yearbook inscription as if it were not news at all but simply another detail that proves that Moore is guilty. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama Breitbart continued. Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. So there you have it. Whether or not you believe the accusations against Roy Moore we now have undeniable proof that one of the main accusers with help from the liberal media publicly lied about her yearbook and then used ABC News to reveal her lie as if it were no big deal.,,,0,0,,

Beverly Young Nelson the ex-waitress who charged that Moore groped her when she was 16 and he was in his 30s told ABC News that she added the date and location of when and where he signed it. Her notes say 12-22-77 and Olde Hickory House the restaurant where Nelson worked and where she said the GOP Alabama Senate candidate was at that time a frequent customer. At her original news conference on Nov. 13 Nelson said Moore signed the yearbook but she didnt mention the notes she added. Nelson will hold a news conference Friday at which her lawyer Gloria Allred said expert evidence would be presented that it was Moores signature. Were going to present evidence that we think is important on the issue whether Roy Moore signed the yearbook Allred told ABC News. Moore has denied all of the allegations against him and claims the entire passage in the yearbook is a forgery.,,,0,0,,

In the city of Tokyo (Japan) the first restaurant in the world that legally offers Humana meat was inaugurated. A scary restaurant nicknamed The Resoto ototo no shoku ryohin which means in English Edible Brother opened its doors to the Japanese public and from all over the world where it offers its customers a varied menu where prices vary from 100 up to 1000 euros that is to say the dish with human flesh more expensive would be 1193 US dollars. International news sources have reported that a tourist from the country of Argentina was the first man to eat human flesh in the Edible Brother. This diner I think the following: It seems like eating pork in this restaurant they cook the meat with spices so the taste goes unnoticed. In Japan since 2014 a law was approved that allows the consumption of human flesh obviously conserving conditions such as the sanitary level of this and the origin. However there is no doubt that at least 99% of the world population would not agree with these grotesque acts so to speak. And the question we all ask ourselves how do they get the meat? The people before dying decide to sell their bodies to the peculiar restaurant approximately for about 30 thousand euros or 35799 dollars this is the balance that those interested can leave their families logically they are the only ones who can claim the money. Only people who die young can sign the contract in which they are subject to a special diet where the meat is suitable for consumption. And would you be willing to sell your body to be consumed after your death?,,,0,0,,

The team already in a market saturated with Dolphins Bucs and Falcons fans made the unfortunate mistake of drafting developing and hiring almost exclusively black players leaving them vulnerable to the latest round of weve been treated unfairly protests from millionaires. This particular protest unfortunately happened on national TV and pissed off every God-fearing country-loving American who has either had the honor to serve or know someone who did. They might as well have wiped their proverbial asses with the American flag. last week 31 of the 42 men on the Jacksonville roster took a knee during the national anthem. The coaches just stopped paying attention and went on with their game planning while the few patriots who braved the picket lines to make sure someone was there to respect the flag and our veterans stood and sang the song with pride. Jacksonville is a dead stick. Its been obvious for several years now that an expansion franchise there was a bad idea. The front office isnt responding to comment but an insider tells us that the reorganization will allow the team to stay above water while they pitch a move to the now-empty St. Louis market. What they dont understand is that their market isnt the main problem. They could survive as another Cardinals or expansion Browns team if they didnt have the issue with the players. Our insider tells us thats being taken care of as well. The selling power of the team is the organization and equipment. Salaries wont be covered in the bankruptcy. After this season as many as 24 players will be on their own.,,,0,0,,

Moores attorney says there are no hard feelings and that his client will continue to fight for womens rights.,,,0,0,,

Muhammad Christopher Blair 53 was born in rural Ohio to a Christian woman and a Muslim man she fell in love with who ultimately abandoned his family but his religion and his hatred of America lived on through Blair who was apparently activated over the weekend when he placed a gold Sacajawea dollar on the tracks above an overpass in Washington state in order to derail the train. Traditionally a penny would be used (thats what you see in old cartoons right?) but the United Railway Administration began requiring changes in trains that would prevent coins at the time from causing damage when kids decided they wanted to play a prank. The gold dollar however is thicker than any currency at the time and is capable to causing a train to derail according to Harvard physics professor Dr. James Wright. The derailment killed three people and injured countless others. While liberals are blaming the disaster on alleged cuts President Trump made to our infrastructure (as he champions his infrastructure plan) the truth is that Blair was responsible. FBI agents raided his home in Delaware where they found bomb making materials as well as a cache of weapons and instructions on making improvised explosive devices. It is unclear why he was in Washington but agents speculate that he thought he would get away and planned further attacks around the country.,,,0,0,,

It is extremely versatile too and is used for cooking wrapping and even for treating some common heath issues. However the problem with this kitchen item is its neurotoxic nature which negatively affects the brain function and it was even found to trigger the onset of Alzheimer`s disease. As explained by medical expert exposure to this metal may lead to mental decline and loss of memory balance bodily control and coordination. --- advertisement --- Additionally it has been scientifically shown that cooking with aluminum foil impacts the bones due to the fact that the metal accumulates in the bones and leads to loss of calcium which is of utmost importance for proper bone health. Cooking with aluminum foil was also found to cause pulmonary fibrosis and other respiratory issues. When exposed to high temperatures through baking or grilling the little bits of the metal end up in the food. Even if these tiny pieces are not released adding certain spices or lemons may cause chemical leaching of aluminum. Essam Zubaidy a chemical engineering researcher at the American University of Sharjah has done an extensive study which looked at the effects of aluminum on cooking. He found that a meal cooked in aluminum foil may contain up to 400 mg of aluminum. The higher the temperature the more the leaching. Foil is not suitable for cooking and is not suitable for using with vegetables like tomatoes citrus juice or spices he explains. To sum up even though this simple tool is budget-friendly and helps prepare tasty meals it is extremely bad for your brain for your bones and ultimately for your lungs. Therefore if you would like to avoid brain-related issues problems with your bones and ending up with a pair of unhealthy lungs make sure you stop cooking with aluminum foil.

She could potentially serve 15 years in prison. From Downtrend: In the hours leading up to the vote on the Tax Cut and Jobs Act out of work loser Rosie ODonnell attempted to bribe Republican Senators to vote against it. Maybe this was her attempt at humor but shes not funny and is an outspoken member of the Resistance. Its almost certain she was serious and a 100% certain that this is a major federal crime for which she could spend 15 years in the slammer. Here are her messages in which she more than likely broke federal law: so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 i will HAPPILY pay any GOP senator 2 million dollars to vote NO they have been paid obviously ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 cold hard cash to any god senator who votes no ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 18 U.S. Code 201 Bribery of public officials and witnesses is pretty clear in defining this crime. Any attempt to influence a public officials public act with an offer of something of value is bribery and a felony. ODonnell offered 4 million dollars which is something of value to get two Senators who are public officials to vote against a tax bill which is a public act. Shes guilty as hell of this. [] The punishment for attempting to bribe a public official is up to 15 years in prison and a fine of three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value. Since she offered 2 million to each senator thats 6 million a piece or 12 million total. But it gets more interesting since she also offered any Republican senator the same deal. There are 52 Republican Senators and at 2 million each that makes 104 million times 3 which is 312 million. In addition shed be looking at 52 cases of trying to bribe a public official so she could also face 780 years in prison. More from NY Daily News: FBI officials neither confirm nor deny investigations. Most prosecutors would use their discretion [Rebecca] Roiphe [a New York law school professor] said look at the context of the political situation and not even interview ODonnell. It all rides on what her intent was in writing that tweet she told the News. And trying to buy influence isnt the point of this whole string of these tweets. What shes trying to do is fake-offer a bribe to point out that theyve already been politically been bought. Liberals like Rosie know the tax cut bill will help the majority of Americans. Theyre still just fighting against President Trump. If they were honest with themselves theyd see that people will enjoy keeping more of their own cash!,,,0,0,,

He first gained national prominence as the pick of Steve Bannon in the Alabama Senate race against Trumps pick Luther Strange and shortly after Moore was declared the winner women including Beverly Young Nelson have come up to claim that Moore had sexually abused them as young women. Ms. Young Nelsons charge comes with the physical evidence of her high school yearbook. She alleged that Moore had signed her yearbook when she was 16. Now 56 she has been showing off the yearbook from 1977 with her lawyer Gloria Allred. In the pages of the yearbook it says: To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Love Roy Moore DA 12-22-77 Olde Hickory House. Since the yearbook evidence was released Roy Moore Republican nominee for Senate said that Beverly is clearly a liar and online detectives and right-wing media outlets have torn her story apart by pointing out that the creepy alleged inscription was written in two different forms of handwriting with two different types of ink. And now oops! Beverly has admitted that part of the inscription was in fact written by her. 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkinss book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial error and writing it down Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters. Buy Now In an interview with ABC who are probably still reeling over the Fake News incident last week that dropped the Dow 350 points and caused Brian Ross to be suspended for being a lyin liar reporter Tom Llamas asks Beverly whether Roy Moore signed her yearbook: BEVERLY YOUNG NELSON: [Yes] he did sign it. TOM LLAMAS: And you made some notes underneath. BEVERLY YOUNG NELSON: Yes. So in a word Beverly has admitted that the inscription is at least a partial forgery. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 And Roy Moores numbers are still above the Democrats in the state of Alabama because the people of the state know Fake News when they hear it. Recently one MSNBC host confronted Gloria Allred on why she felt confidant bringing the yearbook into the public domain asking: If youre not one hundred percent sure that it is [Roys] signature why would you show it at a press conference? The host who deserves an award for doing real journalism and asking simple straightforward questions was unable to get a straight answer from Allred who said that the yearbook had been near Roy Moore and that she only remembers being with him at the time that he allegedly signed it saying that she was thrilled that he signed it. The quick clip is available here and its very telling especially the fact that Allred never bothered to ask Nelson Young if she saw Moore sign the book. Other alleged victims include Leigh Corfman who says that Moore had molested her when she was 14 and Tina Johnson who says that Moore groped her butt while she was in his office in 1991.,,,0,0,,

At least 6 people killed as Amtrak train derails onto highway in Washington state 18 December 2017p Six people have died after 13 cars of an Amtrak train jumped the tracks according to authorities. Seventy-seven people were on board with five crew. The train was making its first-ever run along a faster new route. At least six people have been killed and 77 people were taken to hospital. The death count is expected to rise a US official told AP. Seventy-seven passengers and five crew members were aboard the Cascade 501 train when it was moving at more than 80 mph derailed about 40 miles from Seattle before 8 am Amtrak said according to the Associated Press. Washington State Patrol Trooper Brooke Bova told reporters Monday afternoon that there were seven crew members but she would not say how many died. The train had 12 cars and two engines. Thirteen derailed according to Washington State Patrol Trooper Brooke Bova. She said five motor vehicles and two semi-tractor trailers were hit as derailed train cars landed on the south-bound lane of Interstate-5. Calling the derailment horrific Detective Ed Troyer from the Pierce County Sheriffs Office told reporters there are some rail cars emergency responders still cant access. The emergency responders are working on shoring them up before accessing them. There may be more deceased passengers in those cars Troyer said. The Pierce County sheriffs office has released photos of the mangled train cars dangling off the overpass and blocking the highway. The train was traveling from Tacoma to Olympia and derailed just west of DuPont in Pierce County. An airlift helicopter is on its way to the scene according to KIRO. Seventy-seven people have been transported to area hospitals after the derailment. Passenger Chris Karnes said those on the train were forced to kick out train windows to exit as the emergency doors were not functioning correctly. ""We had just passed the city of DuPont and it seemed like we were going around a curve"" Karnes said as quoted by CBS News. ""All of a sudden we felt this rocking and creaking noise and it felt like we were heading down a hill. The next thing we know were being slammed into the front of our seats windows are breaking we stop and theres water gushing out of the train. People were screaming."" ""The tracks for this line were supposed to be upgraded to be able to handle higher speeds"" Karnes continued. ""Im not sure what happened at this juncture."" President Donald Trump offered his thoughts and prayers on a tweet for those involved in the train derailment. He thanked first responders at the scene. In his first tweet Trump focused on the need for quick approval of a plan for more spending on infrastructure. The National Transportation Safety Board spokesperson said the agency is sending a team of 20 to the scene to conduct an investigation. Washington Governor Jay Inslee has thanked the first responders at the scene and called the incident an ""ongoing and serious situation."" The derailment occurred during morning rush hour and shut down the southbound lanes of Interstate 5 according to the Washington Department of Transportation. Drivers have been advised to avoid the area. The derailed cars are blocking the south-bound lanes of I-5 causing a three-mile backup of vehicles on the interstate according to local media. I-5 has been closed until further notice. Amtrak train 501 was part of a service that launched Monday morning. Trains 504 and 509 have been canceled Amtrak said. According to multiple reports the train was traveling at the speed of over 80 miles per hour when it derailed. It will take ""all day or a couple of days"" to clear the area and finish the investigation Trooper Brooke Bova of Washington State Patrol told reporters. The highway will likely remain shut for the remainder of Monday she dded. The most obvious explanation is the decrepid infrastructure from an imperial power in decline because of a generation of constant wars. It seems CNN is allowed to ask the questions... While Donald Trump isnt. The media cant help themselves from rushing in to condemn the president from stating the obvious. Its insensitive you see President Trump used the occasion of Mondays fatal train crash in Washington state to tout his proposed infrastructure plan one he has been promising since before the election but has yet to be announced. The train accident that just occurred in DuPont WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly wrote Trump via Twitter. Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads bridges tunnels railways (and more) crumble! Not for long! Full coverage: Washington train derailment After 10 minutes of criticisms that he had ignored those killed and injured in the crash in a rush to politicize the issue Trump issued his condolences.

These train tracks are part of a system of pipelines fracking wells mines clearcuts control centers fiberoptics dams highways and factories that cover the planet and are physical manifestations of a process that is destroying the ecosystems cultures and inhabitants everywhere. Behind this network of infrastructure there are politicians CEOs and bureaucrats who have private security cops prison guards non-profit directors PR consultants and the legacy of 500 years of colonization to back them up. We oppose all of these manifestations infrastructural personal and ideological. We blocked the train tracks because we want to blockade the entire web of domination that is slowly killing us. While law enforcement is still investigating the cause behind the trains derailment ANTIFA reportedly sabotaging the tracks and then deleting the post raises serious question about there potential involvement in Mondays incident.

The young girl just 16-years-old when she was seduced by Schumer committed suicide before her 20th birthday. Schumers daughter Lisa first broke the story because she thought her dad was being a hypocrite about the Roy Moore scandal. Schumer has been one of the most vocal opponents of Judge Moores Senate run on the grounds of some fantasy tale told by a woman who were expected to believe can remember details from 1977 like it was yesterday even though she managed to forget for 40 years. What will end up being the nail in Schumers coffin is the report from Planned Parenthood showing that Schumer paid for not one but two abortions and was the responsible party who picked the girl up from the murder clinic when she was done. Schumers own wife Kaitlyn paid the girls mother nearly $2 million to go away. Until now she was happy to stay in the shadows: Now that the story is public and my daughter isnt the one who did wrong I can finally grieve and she can finally rest. Schumer might want to consider paying her a little bit more money before she opens up completely. He is expected to resign over the allegations as soon as Congress returns from Christmas break.,,,0,0,,

Bullock who plays Jane Calamity Bodine a political strategist in the upcoming movie says her own views are colored by her son Louis. I would like my rights represented and those of my son very selfish views and I think everyone else has them she says.

Bullock who says shed do anything for her son said this internal discussion hinged largely on who else on a larger scale would work to represent Louis best interests. What people would still get together and protest for the greater good? Have we all gotten too scared and too safe? she asked. The 51-year-olds current political mindset was also influenced heavily by her parents. After growing up in a split home one parent was a Republican the other a Democrat she says she learned how to push the limits. The Oscar-winner says that her mother did things that were definitely ahead of her time as a woman. I never realized that there were limitations where I was looked at as less than until I was actually pretty deep in this business and I had a pretty unsettling moment and I went Oh my god Im being treated this way because Im female she said. How Sandra Bullock Found Happiness with Her Great Guy Bryan Randall: All the Details of Their New Romance! I grew up to be exactly who I was supposed to be and have the opinions I wanted to have and didnt realize there were limitations to that she adds. So I thought politically I was pretty open minded and could speak my mind and then I realized I wasnt supposed to.,,,0,0,,

The former celebrity has seemingly grown unhinged during the Trump era and her latest rant may actually put her in danger of going to prison. It all started when ODonnell took to Twitter to attempt to cajole a pair of GOP Senators into voting against the biggest middle class tax cut in American history. so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Now Rosie wisely selected two Senators who seem to despise Trump and seem to enjoy voting with the left but what she didnt realize is that this tax reform bill enjoys broad support from the middle and the right. While no Democrats voted in support of the bill you can bet that was based on politics alone and there were a handful who would have gladly supported this bill (Joe Manchin (D-WV) and his gang of moderate Democrats) if the optics wouldnt have been so ugly for the Democrat Party. However thats not what people are focusing on Instead savvy Internet denizens noticed that Rosie may have just broken federal law in her efforts to impact the tax reform vote. Conservative journalists David Harsanyi and Jeff Jacoby pointed ODonnell to the law she broke: According to 18 USCS prec 201(b) whoever directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official with intent to influence that persons official act will be fined for the offence of bribery. ARREST ROSIE https://t.co/9it4wrcLAh David Harsanyi (@davidharsanyi) December 20 2017 Heres a fun fact @Rosie: Under 18 U.S. Code 201 offering $4 million in bribes to senators to influence a vote is punishable with up to $12m in fines and/or imprisonment for as much as 15 years. https://t.co/MReYBS4UHr https://t.co/uj9RpsOddj Jeff Jacoby (@Jeff_Jacoby) December 20 2017 Then the Daily Wires Ben Shapiro and HotAirs Allahpundit jumped in to join the anti-Rosie fray: Excited for all of you who are consumed with tax reform this morning but right now Rosie ODonnell is a fugitive from the law. Prioritize. Allahpundit (@allahpundit) December 20 2017 If Trump orders Sessions to investigate Rosie he will be carved into Rushmore by Friday. Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) December 20 2017 Yes attempting to bribe our legislators is a federal crime punishable by both major fine and prison time. Im not certain that any prosecutor would be able to prove that ODonnell was seriously attempting to bribe a public official but I am certain that if one of them would have reached out to Rosie and agreed to her terms she would have paid to kill the tax reform bill. Rosie spent the Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning ranting about how the GOP was robbing America stealing from the poor and taking from average citizens. How is this possible? How could a TAX CUT possibly be robbery? Its literally the OPPOSITE. A tax cut means that the average American will now keep more of their hard-earned money not less. The GOP isnt taking more money they are allowing Americans to keep more money. Its the opposite of robbery its philanthropy. The Republican Party just stepped in and told the federal government (and the Democrat Party) that enough was enough there would be no more robbing of the American middle class. Of course no one is accusing Rosie ODonnell of being particularly sane or intelligent. In fact after reading Ben Shapiros brilliant tweet from above Rosie responded to him in the ugliest way possible. suck my dick ben ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 It was at this point that Shapiro proved to be Rosies better by winning the internet with his response. Youre already a felon Rosie. Dont be a homophobic sexual harasser too. https://t.co/U4cEM8Hhg0 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) December 20 2017 Well played Ben well played.

The team already in a market saturated with Dolphins Bucs and Falcons fans made the unfortunate mistake of drafting developing and hiring almost exclusively black players leaving them vulnerable to the latest round of weve been treated unfairly protests from millionaires. This particular protest unfortunately happened on national TV and pissed off every God-fearing country-loving American who has either had the honor to serve or know someone who did. They might as well have wiped their proverbial asses with the American flag. last week 31 of the 42 men on the Jacksonville roster took a knee during the national anthem. The coaches just stopped paying attention and went on with their game planning while the few patriots who braved the picket lines to make sure someone was there to respect the flag and our veterans stood and sang the song with pride. Jacksonville is a dead stick. Its been obvious for several years now that an expansion franchise there was a bad idea. The front office isnt responding to comment but an insider tells us that the reorganization will allow the team to stay above water while they pitch a move to the now-empty St. Louis market. What they dont understand is that their market isnt the main problem. They could survive as another Cardinals or expansion Browns team if they didnt have the issue with the players. Our insider tells us thats being taken care of as well. The selling power of the team is the organization and equipment. Salaries wont be covered in the bankruptcy. After this season as many as 24 players will be on their own.,,,0,0,,

That seems unimaginable in 2017 because for years the comedian has become known for angry and demented political rantings all hard-left of course up to and including theorizing that the September 11 terrorist attacks were an inside job. So really it should come as no surprise that 2017 Rosie would see nothing wrong with openly attempting to bribe elected lawmakers to vote the way she wants but the spectacle is hilarious all the same. At the Daily Wire Ben Shapiro collects ODonnells tweets and the relevant federal statutes shes flagrantly violating: susan 2 million dollars cash call if u want to negotiate do u think your family is proud of u @sennatorcollins woman mother grandmother sister daughter u have betrayed us all dear god ask for forgiveness redeem ur soul tomorrow #NOTSEXIST pic.twitter.com/wa0QcMXNk2 ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 I think the most surprising thing about this story isnt that ODonnell is so open about corruption again weve known she was a raving lunatic for years but that she supposedly has $4 million cash on hand with which to buy off politicians. I mean she hasnt exactly been A-list for quite a while And make no mistake this is illegal as all get-out according to 18 USC 201(b): Whoever (1)directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity with intent (A) to influence any official act; or (B) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing or collude in or allow any fraud or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud on the United States; or (C) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person; shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value whichever is greater or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years or both and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor trust or profit under the United States. Not a lot of gray area in there. Boy wouldnt it be wild to end the first year of Donald Trumps presidency with Trumps administration justifiably prosecuting one of his most famous Twitter feud opponents? I feel sorry for Rosie s new partner in love whose parents are devastated at the thought of their daughter being with @Rosiea true loser. Donald J.

Dont be a homophobic sexual harasser too. https://t.co/U4cEM8Hhg0 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) December 20 2017 Because concepts like coherence and logic are lost on Rosie heres apparently the best she could muster in retaliation: (Do you think Rosie knows Shapiro was a NeverTrumper?) Because even she knows she cant make a positive case for bribing senators ODonnell has apparently settled on the I was just kidding defense if her retweets of followers like this are indicative: The dear @Rosie makes a joke about bribing the @GOP to make a point and the Alt-reich goes bat shit crazy. Its like they dont have humor in Russia. Pesach Pace Lattin (@pacelattin) December 20 2017 This is kind of the perfect way to close out the insane year that has been 2017.

Ladies of Liberty reports that the small town of Bordalama Alabama was beset by fraudsters who apparently posed as dead people bringing the vote totals to 953 for Roy Moore and 5327 for Democrat Jones. There are only 1867 registered voters in Bordalama. In addition Jones was caught red-handed campaigning at a polling location and authorities apprehended a van full of illegals that was traveling from polling place to polling place voting for Jones. Now more dead folks have been found voting for Jones this time in Birmingham. State election officials have determined that more than 12000 votes (thats 5329 more than yesterday) so far in the state of Alabama are null and void because the voters dont appear to be living local news station WYKY reported Wednesday. It appears that these voters names were never removed from the rolls when they passed away and someone used their information to stack votes for Doug Jones. Already 150000 have signed a petition on Change.org asking the State Board of Election Integrity to investigate the very obvious instances of voter fraud that have occurred in Alabama in the last few days. So far no one has responded to the call for an investigation.,,,0,0,,

Different color ink. Inconsistencies with the signature. The DA label even though Roy Moore wasnt D.A. at the time. The fact Gloria Allred refused to let an expert look at it. It didnt add up. On Friday the story completely blew up. The great John Nolte has the details. Beverly Young Nelson has finally admitted that she forged a portion of the infamous high school yearbook that she and attorney Gloria Allred used as proof of her accusations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore. And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 This is huge. The rest of Noltes piece explains the many many inconsistencies with the allegations but this revelation makes it abundantly clear that this yearbook entry was forged. She admitted to messing with it. Thats pretty much all the evidence we need. Here is more from Nolte. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore. One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14 year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfman living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (The Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. This media narrative is crumbling fast. Geez. Even if shes telling the truth about that still being Moores signature (and I still believe it is) this is bad for her story. Should have disclosed. Shouldnt have hired Gloria Allred. https://t.co/AqgSVCNlCV Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) December 8 2017 Why the hell would Allred not have advised her to a.) admit up front that she wrote the date and location under Moores signature to memorialize it and b.) immediately submit it for handwriting analysis? Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) December 8 2017 Are we really supposed to believe that these allegations just magically appeared out of nowhere from 40 years ago right before the election as a total coincidence? Roy Moore has been around for decades and no one brought this up. All of a sudden right before the election hes a monster? You really have to suspend disbelief to buy this story. Yes if he did those things with a 14-year-old hes a bad guy. But its not even remotely a fact he did that. So many of these allegations against Moore have been exposed as just ridiculous. Remember when everyone was running around saying Moore was banned from a mall as if that was a fact? It wasnt a fact and it now actually looks false.,,,0,0,,

ODonnell has been known to tweet out some pretty inflammatory and vulgar posts in the past but this time she has blatantly broken the law. Will she be held accountable? Only time will tell. Yesterday in response to news about the GOPs coming victory on tax reform ODonnell completely lost it on Twitter like many other wealthy hypocrites who act like they care about the middle class or anyone but themselves. But ODonnell took a different approach; she decided to bribe two senators that she felt with her best bet at defecting from what turned out to be strict party line votes. Rosie tweeted: so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no sh*t 2 million cash each Ignorance is no excuse for breaking the law but I am guessing Rosie either forgot or never learned that bribery is a very serious crime in this country. She may be a former comedian but there is nothing in this tweet to indicate it was a joke. Not even close. Her offer of bribes for votes is a clear violation of US Code 18 U.S. Code 201 Bribery of public officials and witnesses. Jeff Jacoby of the Boston Globe tweeted to Rosie in response Heres a fun fact @ Rosie: Under 18 U.S. Code 201 offering $4 million in bribes to senators to influence a vote is punishable with up to $12m in fines and/or imprisonment for as much as 15 years. What are the chances the feds will show up at Rosies door today? I am thinking her attorneys are in a bit of a frenzy at this point. I cant think how they could possibly defend her on this one. Especially given that she continued her Twitter tirade with these tweets the first of which also included a picture of Susan Collins family : susan 2 million dollars cash call if u want to negotiate do u think your family is proud of u @sennatorcollins woman mother grandmother sister daughter u have betrayed us all dear god ask for forgiveness redeem ur soul tomorrow #NOTSEXIST And then there was this classy tweet: Rachel meadow asks was susan collins engaged did u feel a heartbeat was she human SHE THINKS ITS SEXIST ? NO U SEE SUSAN STOOD AND SAID NO I WONT KILL AMERICANS AND NOW SHE SAYS YES YES I WILL KILL AMERICANS F*CK U SUSAN COLLINS U MAKE ME SICK UR NO WOMAN Perhaps Rosie could write those checks straight to the government that she loves so much! Nobody is stopping her from giving some of her estimated $100 million to the IRS! Imagine Rosie behind bars. While it seems crazy to even think that she would end up being held accountable it seems to be a pretty open and shut case. There is no reason why she should get away with this! A mega-rich Hollywood elitist being held accountable now that would be a Christmas miracle! Source: Breitbart.com,,,0,0,,

As reported by Breitbart News Beverly Nelson and her attorney Gloria Allred have used the yearbook as evidence that Moore was romantically attracted to Nelson when she was in high school in the late 1970s and he was an adult district attorney in Etowah County. In an appearance with Allred on ABC News Good Morning America program on Friday however Nelson admitted that she added notes to the alleged message left by Moore since. She has claimed that in 1977 Moore groped her in the parking lot of a restaurant where she worked. Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription ABC News tells us. But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbook ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson said. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 Critics immediately pounced on the admission with many demanding to know why Nelson and Allred werent upfront about Nelsons changes when the accusations were made and the yearbook introduced as evidence. Moore and his attorneys have called the signature completely false and requested weeks ago to have an independent handwriting expert examine the yearbook. We demand that you immediately release the yearbook to a neutral custodian so that our expert and you can send you expert as well so that our expert can look at it not a copy on the internet the campaign attorney Phillip L. Jauregui said last month. The actual document so we can see the lettering. We can see the ink on the page. We can see the indentations and we can see how old is that ink. Is it 40 years old or is it a week old? He said that he did not want to make any allegations but mentioned that the two 77s signed in the yearbook should be looked at. Also Moore has said he never signed his name followed by the letters D.A. for district attorney. Were going to present evidence that we think is important on the issue whether Roy Moore signed the yearbook Nelsons lawyer Allred told ABC News Friday.

Mary Lynne Davies who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines.

Davies who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. Her attorney says she sticks by her story: My clients main concern is that because of the yearbook thing nobody will believe her story. She fabricated the yearbook because nobody would listen in the first place. Shes a victim and now shell be prosecuted while her abuser goes to the US Senate. Nothing about this is right. Nothing. Nothing about this is wrong jerk. Justice Moore is a fine upstanding man who has shown time and time again that he loves America and our family values. He deserves to be exonerated.

300,http://timesconservative.com/?p=258,https://www.snopes.com/muslim-amtrak-derailment/,2017-12-22,1000.0,false,On Monday an Amtrak train derailed above Interstate 5 in Dupont Washington. This disaster killed several people on the train and injured several others according to Fake News CNN who note that the deaths are all contained to the train. According to the Washington Department of Transportation and Human Welfare something caused it to come off the tracks. It is unclear as of yet how many people were killed but what CNN isnt mentioning is that we do know what caused this accident and it was not an accident. Breitbart reports that police scanners at the time of the derailment cops were searching for a man of Middle Eastern appearance in the area who was seen walking away from the overpass from which part of the train hung for hours with passengers inside. Twenty minutes later Patrol Car 42 announced suspect apprehended. While no official report has been released chatter on the radio indicates that someone had placed a gold dollar on the track a trick anyone can learn from childrens television in an effort to derail the train. Traditionally a penny would be used but in 1949 the United Railway Association required changes in trains that would allow them to pass over a penny without derailing. A quarter is not thick enough but a Sacajawea gold dollar is. While we dont have an official confirmation that this was related to terrorism its not exactly normal for a Muslim man to be apprehended near the scene of a major disaster without it being terrorism is it?,,,0,0,,

In the city of Tokyo (Japan) the first restaurant in the world that legally offers Humana meat was inaugurated. A scary restaurant nicknamed The Resoto ototo no shoku ryohin which means in English Edible Brother opened its doors to the Japanese public and from all over the world where it offers its customers a varied menu where prices vary from 100 up to 1000 euros that is to say the dish with human flesh more expensive would be 1193 US dollars. International news sources have reported that a tourist from the country of Argentina was the first man to eat human flesh in the Edible Brother This diner I think the following: It seems like eating pork in this restaurant they cook the meat with spices so the taste goes unnoticed. In Japan since 2014 a law was approved that allows the consumption of human flesh obviously conserving conditions such as the sanitary level of this and the origin. However there is no doubt that at least 99% of the world population would not agree with these grotesque acts so to speak. And the question we all ask ourselves how do they get the meat? The people before dying decide to sell their bodies to the peculiar restaurant approximately for about 30 thousand euros or 35799 dollars this is the balance that those interested can leave their families logically they are the only ones who can claim the money. Only people who die young can sign the contract in which they are subject to a special diet where the meat is suitable for consumption. And would you be willing to sell your body to be consumed after your death?,,,0,0,,

The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for the last two years insisting she needed breast implants and begging for a surgery. Her mother Dana Manson says she tried to convince Juliet that her breasts would grow with time but her daughter was completely obsessed with the idea of getting breast implants. She would ask us multiple times a day every day she told NBC. There was nothing in the world that she wanted more than having boobs. Ms Manson even consulted a psychiatrist with her daughter hoping to rid Juliet of her obsession. The result however was very different from what she expected. After a dozen sessions with young girl the renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez concluded that she was suffering from a severe depression and had a serious lack of self-esteem and told her mother that a surgery could be beneficial. Doctor Ramirez says the young girl has developed some serious complexes about her appearance over the years and the operation will help her get an improved image of herself. Following the psychiatrists advice Ms Manson contacted dozens on clinics in the United States and Mexico but none of them were willing to perform a breast augmentation surgery on such a young girl. She finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China where doctors were willing to perform the operation. Dana Manson decided that she would go on the trip to Asia with her daughter over the holidays and that the surgery would count as her Christmas present. They left for China on December 22 and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned. The young girl now has a 30C cup and her mother says shes extremely happy about her about her new breasts. Dana Manson told NBC that like every mother in the world she wanted her children to be happy and that Juliet was clearly unhappy about not having any breasts. The young girls story caught the worlds attention after she posted several pictures of herself on her Instagram account only hours after the surgery instantly causing a storm of reactions on the social media. Many people are denouncing the Manson parents for allowing their daughter to undergo plastic surgery at such a young age while others are blaming her psychiatrist for his recommendation. Despite the critics Dana Manson says she did what was best for her daughter and insists that she has no regrets.,,,0,0,,

The Bermuda Triangle Bermuda Triangle does not need any introduction. If you ever read anything upon the biggest unsolved mysteries in the world I am sure Bermuda Triangle wouldve topped that list! It is famous for sucking in (mysteriously) anything and everything that comes in its area. Right from flights to ships everything has lost its way in here. But what happened recently might just be the curse breaker for this scary place. 2. The Reappeared Ship Apparently something happened that this Triangle is not really known for. A ship that was lost recently reappeared magically behind the winds within the waves. Well this is no joke my friends. On a very serious note a ship just reappeared mysteriously out of nowhere. 3. Was First Spotted On The Cuban Coast Guard announced that they had intercepted an unmanned ship heading for the island which is presumed to be the SS Cotopaxi a tramp steamer which vanished in December 1925 and has since been connected to the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. See told yll I was serious! This ship was first spotted on May 16 near a restricted military zone west of Havana by the Cuban authorities! They made many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the crew and finally mobilised three patrol boats to intercept it. 4. When It First Vanished On 29 November 1925 the SS Cotopaxi departed Charleston South Carolina and headed towards Havana Cuba. The ship had a crew of 32 men under the command of Captain W. J. Meyer and was carrying a cargo of 2340 tons of coal. It was reported missing two days later and was unheard of for almost 90 years. When the ship was first lost no one mustve imagined that itll reappear 90 years later in such condition. But to everyones surprise it did! 5. The Investigation The Vice President of Council of Ministers General Abelardo Colome announced that the Cuban authorities were going to conduct a thorough investigation to elucidate the mystery of the ships disappearance and reappearance. After this incident the scientists are already excited about the new pattern of research theyll conduct in the area. Lets wait an watch if some more missing things resurface back in this area! Hopefully!,,,0,0,,

Under Obamas lead schools were teaching that Islam is a peaceful religion even though all of our real life examples contradict that. Treddify reported that Judge Neil Gorsuch cast the tie-breaking vote. The 5-4 ruling was that the only part of Islam history taught in public schools will be Radical Islam and what students can do to help stop it. Judge Gorsuch wrote The government certainly has no business being involved in religion but this isnt a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion. We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity as our founders wanted and we certainly shouldnt be filling the children with lies about Islam being a religion of peace when they see the carnage on the news almost every day. Gorsuch continued It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated. This is an additional ruling from the one just last week that forbids the teaching of Islamic tenets or Sharia as part of world history as well. The Obama administration obviously has no power or influence in the court anymore. Our country and Christianity scored a huge win. Thanks to our president we can get back to respecting our true values and the normal every day worshipping of the only real God. Comments comments,,,0,0,,

The State Attorneys Division of Integrity in Elections is calling the acts of the women a blatant disregard for the duties of civil servants a violation of the public trust and a 2nd-degree felony. Wanda Werkmeister Olivia Pertuiary and Maureen Brown will all face charges of conspiracy to contribute to widespread voter fraud and violation of the public trust both punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a million dollars in fines. Roy Moores campaign on the news that voter fraud was rampant in Birmingham and all of Applevale County is standing by at the door of the clerks office to the 17th District Federal Court of Appeals to file an injunction against a single vote from the Democrat stronghold to be counted. Pundits on both sides are speculating that the outcome will almost certainly be a Roy Moore win. Sean Hannity speaking as a guest on Dana Loeschs new show Guns God and Grits said: Without that inner-city ghetto vote Doug Jones doesnt have a chance. It doesnt make much sense why someone from the citys vote is so much more important to Democrats who swear they arent at all racist. The Alabama Office of Election Certification and Ethics says it will abide by the wishes of the Secretary of State before certifying the vote and sending it to the governor for his signature.,,,0,0,,

The bill passed straight down party lines in the Senate with lone holdout Jeff Flake (R-AZ) eventually getting with the program even after publicly uttering noises of dissent. And ODonnell did not sit idly by and spectate but apparently tweet-attempted to sway Flake and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) with an offer of $2 million apiece (in cash!) if theyd kill the tax bill by voting against it. Yes the former self-declared Queen of Nice may have tried to publicly bribe two on-the-fence Republican senators in multiple tweets. Below she made this request in her typically poetic style of tweeting: NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no sh*t 2 million cash each. ODonnell also (possibly its hard to tell) accused Collins of betraying all women with this tax vote while encouraging the female senator to dear god ask for forgiveness redeem ur soul tomorrow. No one really knows if ODonnell was simply trolling or seriously trying to bribe these senators but if its a case of the latter shed best be careful. Under federal law its illegal to attempt to influence official acts (including legislative votes) of public officials with offers of money. As one can imagine the social media backlash against ODonnells tweets got ugly and saw Ben Shapiro tweet LOCK HER UP! To which ODonnell responded suck my d*ck ben. (Via Cornell LLI),,,0,0,,

When Willis was asked about his opinion on Trumps presidency so far he said: I think that hes doing great. In fact he just might be the best US President ever. Fallon then asked him if he was serious about this statement because it would definitely sound like an exaggeration to many people. Willis responded: Yeah Im being serious about this. Trump has always been a winner and to be honest I cant think of a better man to lead America at this moment. Bruce Willis is one the few conservatives in Hollywood who are not afraid to express their support for President Trump. He has always been a fan of Trump and everything that he represents a successful businessman and a role model for every young American. Willis added: Trump has a winning mentality and I,,,0,0,,

Julia Roberts was speaking on the New York set of her new film as principal photography began on the drama Ben Is Back. Michelle Obama paid a visit to the film production while in the vicinity and Julia Roberts agreed to meet her however she opened up about the differences between Americas most recent First Ladies as soon as Michelle left the set. Melania has her priorities straight and she is a great example for our young women Julia Roberts said. Michelle? Talk about a wolf in sheepskin. The news comes days after Julia Roberts slammed Celine Dion for criticizing the POTUS and stating that she hates America. I cant even look at an American flag anymore. I hate this country Canadian Celine Dion said while complaining about the Trump presidency. Youre wrong Celine Julia Roberts fired back. The America we know and love was destroyed by Obama and his disastrous presidency. If you disagree you can always go back to your own country. In fact perhaps you really should. Celine Dion was one of dozens of liberal celebrities who threatened to leave the United States and return to their homelands if America elected Donald Trump as president. So far a grand total of zero of these liberal celebrities have followed through with their threat to leave. The sheer hypocrisy makes it hard to believe they really feel as strongly as they claim about Trump. Its all hot air and virtue signaling from the celebrity contingent on the left.,,,0,0,,

Tom and Janis Morrison a young couple from the small town of Greensboro in Alabama called 911 around 10:00 pm last night to ask for an ambulance. To read full article click below!!! Samantha Irving the operator who took the call says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation. The woman told me that her husband had fallen and that his head was now stuck in her vaginal cavity. I really thought that it was a group of teenagers making a prank call. Despite Ms. Irvings doubts she sent an ambulance on the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious. Bill Austin one of the paramedics who transported the couple claims they were lying naked on their bed and partially covered in blood. The woman kept screaming out in pain whenever the guy moved but he had half of his face buried in there and he looked like he was going through Hell! The couple was transported to the nearby Hale County Hospital where doctors were able to separate the couple. Ms. Morrison suffered from severe internal bleeding but is now stable while her husband has suffered only a few scratches and bruises. According to doctors both could also suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome. Incidents like this one are indeed quite unusual but hundreds of couples are admitted to the hospital every year in the U.S. after getting stuck together during sexual intercourse. According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 3213 couples were hospitalized for such problems across the country in 2015 and 3789 in 2016. According to the same data the Morrisons are the first couple to be hospitalized for a head stuck inside a vaginal cavity since October 2007.,,,0,0,,

Jessie Does DNA results matched that of Elvis Aaron Presley who was thought to have died in 1977. Lab technician Robert Brensdale said he and his lab assistant Madeline Hedgespeth laughed when the name popped up. We thought somebody somewhere somehow in the system pulled the greatest and most elaborate prank on us ever we both laughed with hysteria for about an hour Bresndale told Jerry Hardin of the Hollywood Word a new entertainment publication based out of Los Angeles. Brensdale and Hedgespeth then went to their superior with laughter as if he were the one behind this prank. They were told to simmer down and stay quiet that this was no laughing matter. From there the results went up the ladder to the FBI and CIA. Now weeks later FBI spokesperson Philip Hunter has revealed that the deceased mans body was actually the body of Elvis Presley who had been in the witness protection program since 1977.

But what happened recently might just be the curse breaker for this scary place. 2. The Reappeared Ship Apparently something happened that this Triangle is not really known for. A ship that was lost recently reappeared magically behind the winds within the waves. Well this is no joke my friends. On a very serious note a ship just reappeared mysteriously out of nowhere. 3. Was First Spotted On The Cuban Coast Guard announced that they had intercepted an unmanned ship heading for the island which is presumed to be the SS Cotopaxi a tramp steamer which vanished in December 1925 and has since been connected to the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. See told yll I was serious! This ship was first spotted on May 16 near a restricted military zone west of Havana by the Cuban authorities! They made many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the crew and finally mobilized three patrol boats to intercept it. 4. When It First Vanished On 29 November 1925 the SS Cotopaxi departed Charleston South Carolina and headed towards Havana Cuba. The ship had a crew of 32 men under the command of Captain W. J. Meyer and was carrying a cargo of 2340 tons of coal. It was reported missing two days later and was unheard of for almost 90 years. When the ship was first lost no one mustve imagined that itll reappear 90 years later in such condition. But to everyones surprise it did! 5. The Investigation The Vice President of Council of Ministers General Abelardo Colome announced that the Cuban authorities were going to conduct a thorough investigation to elucidate the mystery of the ships disappearance and reappearance. After this incident the scientists are already excited about the new pattern of research theyll conduct in the area. Lets wait an watch if some more missing things resurface back in this area!

After being accused of political incorrectness Freeman laughed again saying Its all about being loving and caring these days isnt it?The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else. The veteran actor who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else. In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russias meddling in the 2016 presidential election.While insisting that the Kremlins election interference is no movie script and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not Morgan said we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth. We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say My fellow Americans. During this past election we cam under attack by the Russian government Freeman demands Trump to say adding Ive called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.,,,0,0,,

We can see him being dragged in the water then he disappears from sight. He was probably dead within thirty seconds of the attack. Although Mr. Olsens is the first zoo worker to die while having sexual intercourse with an animal he is not the first one to be implicated in an incident implicating bestiality.

On the Dale Jackson Radio Show Monday morning Rep. Brooks cited his experience in the court of law claiming there are holes in Beverly Nelsons accusations based off what hes seen on TV. ""My evaluation of the evidence is that there is only the remotest of possible chances that if this went into a court of law that a jury would find Roy Moore guilty of anything that`s how flimsy the evidence is"" Brooks said on WVNN-FM. Later in the interview Brooks declared Moores signature in the yearbook as a forgery. ""One of those is clearly a liar because that one forged the Love Roy Moore part of a yearbook in order to try to whatever reason get at Roy Moore and win this seat for the Democrats"" Brooks said. The statute of limitations will prevent Nelsons case from ever seeing a courtroom but its undoubtedly playing out right now in the Alabama Court of Public Opinion. Dale Jackson says the former Madison County DA raises valid questions. ""I don`t think he`s calling her a liar per say I think he`s raising doubt. And he wants to see what I want to see. Let`s see the yearbook get it authenticated and let`s figure out who`s lying"" Jackson told WHNT News 19 in an interview on Tuesday. So far in the court of public opinion weve heard from the accusers and the accused. One day after Beverly Nelsons accusations were made public Roy Moore held a news conference disputing every aspect of her story. ""I never did what she said I did. I don`t even know the woman. I don`t know anything about her. I don`t even know where the restaurant is or was"" Moore stated on November 14th. Weve also heard from a stable of witnesses. Two weeks ago the Moore Campaign introduced WHNT News 19 to a former server who also called Nelsons story into question. ""I never once saw Roy Moore come into the restaurant in all the time that I worked there"" Ledbetter told WHNT News 19 in an interview that aired November 20th. Monday two servers spoke to CNN with stories that contradict claims that Moore never stepped foot in the Olde Hickory House. One of the women went by the name Joan to protect her identity. She says she was 17 years old the first time she met Moore inside the restaurant. ""I saw him in there four and five times a week"" says Joan. On December 12th the jury will deliver their verdict as the voters of Alabama cast their ballots. Jackson believes constant questions over the yearbook can only help Moore at the polls. ""Every time this question is raised Roy Moore picks up votes. Every time doubt is out there because if there`s doubt about one there`s going to be doubt about all of them. Right now it would be more believable if this yearbook didnt exist"" says Jackson. We asked Congressman Brooks for our own interview but he declined stipulating we give him 5 minutes live in a newscast to explain his position. It was an offer we werent able to accommodate. Roy Moores campaign has repeatedly asked for Beverly Nelson to give up the yearbook for third-party examination to see if it is a forgery. Nelsons attorney Gloria Allred has said repeatedly she will not do so unless the Senate conducts an ethics hearing and Moore testifies under oath. So far there hasnt been any indication from Senate leaders that a hearing would take place before the December 12th election.",,,0,0,,

That being said there are some real whoppers that come down the pike from time to time. Stories such as these are awfully tough to take at first glance but they still manage to gain a ton of traction. As Raw Story shares a perfect example of that comes in the form of this story that made the rounds about Malia Obama. A blog known as Freedom Crossroads - America Love It Or Leave It touted some outlandish claims about Malia and many folks fell for it hook line and sinker. ""She was caught by Embassy Security - aka the U.S. Marines - on the roof of the building burning a doobie and playing with the Ambassadors carrier pigeons"" the post alleged. You can see how such news would lead to some seriously furrowed brows. Taken at face value its an explosive story. Something such as this would undoubtedly lead to some serious consequences for the young lady as well. The blog post picks up on that concept and additional salacious claims are dropped. ""She wont be starting Harvard this fall and she has no future in government since all government jobs require drug tests"" the post continues. Woah. That sounds like some major news. You would think that would be plastered all over the place right? Wrong. Not one reputable mainstream outlet picked up on this blatantly false story and it was quickly proven to be false by both Snopes and Politifact. So how did this story get out there to begin with? In fairness to the blog theres a note on the About Us page that points out it ""uses facts that dont exist and relies more on imagination than the truth."" So was this a satire piece? Thats unclear but its readily apparent that this story should not have been taken even the slightest bit seriously. Nonetheless the story gained a head of steam and went viral. Since it was shared so many times scores of users took it seriously. Therein lies the lesson for all of us in todays day and age: If you cant quickly verify the validity of a story you should dismiss it until additional information emerges. That information may never come or it can take on the form of a flat out dismissal from more reputable sites. Of course not all of us have time to dig into each and every piece of news making the rounds so that makes it even more challenging. When thats the case listen to your gut. If something is telling you it doesnt seem right take a second to do a simple search for the story and see if it appears elsewhere. If the only source is a blog you never heard of or an obscure website you would be wise to take it with a grain of salt until theres some more info out there. You dont always have to be the first one to share a big piece of news but you will seriously enhance your own credibility by only sharing verifiable items.

And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription. Worse still the reporter actually coaches Nelson puts words in her mouth downplay the enormous significance of her deceit. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription ABC News tells us. But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbook ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence. Llamas also fails to ask any follow-ups such as If the explanation is this simple why wait all these weeks to offer it? Or Why did you lie? Nelson is accusing Moore of attempting to assault her when she was just 16-years-old. With the election just four days away this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for Moore. Nelson and Allred are planning a news conference Friday but nothing will overcome the forgery admission. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama. Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. Now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore. One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfmans living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. Thanks to New Medias going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moores office on business. If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an unfit absent and unstable mother. If the media and the accusers and Gloria Allred told the full truth to begin with they would all be more credible. As far as the accusations against Moore involving his wanting to date teenage girls those are trumped-up charges utter nonsense. The age of consent in Alabama was and is 16. Moreover 40 years ago it was not at all uncommon in the South for a 32-year-old man to seek a much younger bride. So not only did Moore not break the law he was not violating any social mores.

Jeff Flake (R-AZ) in exchange for a no vote on Tuesday nights tax cut vote (an act that is unquestionably illegal). Both senators voted yay. As the GOPs historic tax bill won the approval of both the House and Senate (on a party-line vote) ODonnell became increasingly unhinged.

Also included in the bill is the long-overdue opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve (ANWR) to oil exploration (and the much-needed the jobs that come with it) and the repeal of the Obamacare mandate that forces every American to buy health insurance a tax that primarily brutalizes those making $50000 or less.

WE CANNOT SIT AT HOME WHILE THEY ROB OUR NATION YOUR NEIGHBORS HEALTH CARE FOR THE FUCKING MERCERS AND KOCH BROTHERS FUCK THEM RISE UP ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 ODonnell who is very wealthy will almost certainly benefit from this tax cut.

According to CNBC Stefan Bogdanovich and Dakota Speas brought a class action lawsuit in California where they are residents against Apple an official filing revealed Thursday. They claim that Apple never requested consent from them to slow down their iPhones. Both plaintiffs are owners of an iPhone 7 CNBC explained. Bogdanovich and Speas claim they suffered interferences to their iPhone usage due to the intentional slowdowns. The two Apple customers are also claiming economic damages and other harm for which they are entitled to compensation and are trying to get the case certified to cover all people in the United States who owned an Apple phone older than the iPhone 8. Apple confirmed they were slowing down older iPhone models on Wednesday claiming it was in an effort to prevent random shutdowns which were taking place due to old lithium-ion batteries. Several users on Twitter had claimed their devices were being throttled before Apple admitted to the practice and many alleged the company was slowing down iPhones in an effort to force customers to upgrade.

Michelle Obama paid a visit to the film production while in the vicinity and Julia Roberts agreed to meet her however she opened up about the differences between Americas most recent First Ladies as soon as Michelle left the set. Melania has her priorities straight and she is a great example for our young women Julia Roberts said. Michelle? Talk about a wolf in sheepskin. The news comes days after Julia Roberts slammed Celine Dion for criticizing the POTUS and stating that she hates America. I cant even look at an American flag anymore. I hate this country Canadian Celine Dion said while complaining about the Trump presidency. Youre wrong Celine Julia Roberts fired back. The America we know and love was destroyed by Obama and his disastrous presidency. If you disagree you can always go back to your own country. In fact perhaps you really should. Celine Dion was one of dozens of liberal celebrities who threatened to leave the United States and return to their homelands if America elected Donald Trump as president. So far a grand total of zero of these liberal celebrities have followed through with their threat to leave. The sheer hypocrisy makes it hard to believe they really feel as strongly as they claim about Trump.

Latifah Brown called 911 around 9:30 PM last night reporting that she had a baby stuck in her vagina. The operator first assumed that she was giving birth at home and dispatched an ambulance to the site. The paramedics had quite a surprise when they arrived on the site and saw what was actually happening. One of the paramedics Brian Whitmore related the incident in an interview with WBNS-10 TV. The little boy wore a diaper and pyjamas but he had his legs and abdomen stuck in the womans vagina. The paramedics spent more than an hour on the site trying to release the child from his difficult position but were unable to get the toddler out. I dont know how she got the child in there! We were both pulling as strong as we could and he wouldnt come out. Ms. Brown and the child were finally transported to the hospital where doctors were able to separate them after a delicate operation. The young boy suffers from a dislocated hip but doctors dont think he will suffer any sequelae from the incident. The paramedic Ryan Whitmore says he was shocked when he arrived on the scene and saw the fully dressed toddler caught in the womans vagina. The babysitter was interrogated by police and confessed to deliberately inserting the child in her vaginal cavity. She explained that she was feeling depressed after her doctor told her she could never have children and wanted to know how it felt to give birth. Ms. Brown now faces a total of 11 criminal charges including aggravated child neglect causing bodily harm and could spend up to 65 years in prison. Her lawyer has asked for a psychiatric evaluation claiming that she isnt fit to stand trial. Depending on the results of the evaluation her trial could begin in June.,,,0,0,,

The investigation that has gathered thousands of DNA samples and testimonies over a 15-year period ultimately proves the man is the father to literally thousands of illegitimate children in the region. Contraception wasnt very popular in those days he told local reporters in his defence. I have nothing to be ashamed of. The 60s were the good old days and I did a great Johnny Cash impression which played out real good with the ladies he explained. Some even thought I was Johnny Cash for real he recalls laughingly. I dont know if they really believed it or if they were trying to convince themselves but who was I to say no to a quickie? he acknowledged. Author Anthony Kendall has teamed up with private investigator Sid Roy and will publish the results of the 15-year investigation next fall in an upcoming book Unraveling the truth Private investigator Sid Roy could never have imagined a simple gig would end up in a 15-year quest for the truth. It all started in 2001 when two different men that had nothing to do with each other hired me to find their biological father. I was astounded after further investigation to realize they both originated from the same person he explained. That is when the mystery started unraveling and it became a personal mission of mine whenever I had some free time Id try and track down other testimonies. Eventually DNA testing became really cheap and easy to use and helped me gather a lot of information in the latest years he acknowledged. No lawsuit in sight The private investigator says the children of the old man dont intend to pursue any lawsuit against the old man. Most people who are aware of the truth dont want this information to get out and have given anonymous testimonies he explains. The truth unleashed could break up hundreds or more families and thats definitely not the point of all these years of research. All I know is that most people are glad to know the truth and dont bear any grudge against the old man I guess it was a more common practice in those days he acknowledges. Although DNA testing and testimonies point out to over 1300 illegitimate children fathered by the retired postman Sid Roy believes there could be much more. Ive spent 15 years of my own personal time into this I think its enough he admits. But my research clearly shows there could be many more children he told local reporters although he declined to comment if the numbers were in the hundreds or thousands more.,,,0,0,,

The State Attorneys Division of Integrity in Elections is calling the acts of the women a blatant disregard for the duties of civil servants a violation of the public trust and a 2nd-degree felony.

Roy Moores campaign on the news that voter fraud was rampant in Birmingham and all of Applevale County is standing by at the door of the clerks office to the 17th District Federal Court of Appeals to file an injunction against a single vote from the Democrat stronghold to be counted. Pundits on both sides are speculating that the outcome will almost certainly be a Roy Moore win. Sean Hannity speaking as a guest on Dana Loeschs new show Guns God and Grits said: Without that inner-city ghetto vote Doug Jones doesnt have a chance. It doesnt make much sense why someone from the citys vote is so much more important to Democrats who swear they arent at all racist.

Heres the tape from ABC News: Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 Nelson stated of Moores denial That really hurt me. God knows and Roy knows and I know what happened. He did sign it. When asked by a reporter if she made notes underneath she answered Yes. This is bad enough its ridiculous that attorney Gloria Allred and Nelson didnt reveal that fact when they originally showed the yearbook. It calls into question whether any of the other writing was tampered with; being honest and forthright would have been the only decent policy here. Whats more Nelson writing the time and location under Moores signature but failing to disclose it pegs the date to Nelsons memory without acknowledging that Moore didnt date the signature in the first place. But conservative media immediately decided to deliberately overplay Nelsons actual statement. Breitbart headlined: Bombshell: Roy Moore Accuser Beverly Nelson Admits She Forged Yearbook. Fox News headlined: BREAKING NEWS: Roy Moore accuser admits she forged part of yearbook inscription attributed to Alabama senate candidate https://t.co/Z5cXgC8YTk pic.twitter.com/AdPF5J7wh1 Fox News (@FoxNews) December 8 2017 All Moore supporters were looking for was a peg to hang their charges of forgery on; Nelson and Allred provided the peg. But its simply untrue to say that Nelson admitted she forged the yearbook. She insists that the note and signature from Moore are authentic. Whats more we know that another woman claims she has a copy of a graduation card with Moores signature. And there is another accuser who says Moore molested her when she was 14 and several other women under 18 who say Moore tried to date them when he was in his early 30s. Theres no reason to lie about the story here. Nelson wrote in the yearbook. She didnt reveal it. That raises reasonable doubts. But she did not admit to forging Moores signature or his note.,,,0,0,,

During an interview with ABC News Nelson made the bombshell admission which was immediately glossed over by the mainstream media reporter who acted as if her admitting she forged at least part of the yearbook was no big deal. As Breitbart reported In yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription. Worse still the reporter actually coaches Nelson puts words in her mouth downplay the enormous significance of her deceit. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 The ABC News reporter in a pathetic attempt at pretending what he was about to say wasnt huge news quickly revealed Nelsons deceit before pretending it wasnt deceitful at all. Make no mistake this is the mainstream media openly covering for a women they are trying to use to take out an anti-establishment Republican. Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription the ABC News reporter reveals. But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbook ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence the Breitbart report continued. This is about as transparent as it gets. ABC News attempted to have Nelson reveal the stunning fact that she forged part of the yearbook inscription as if it were not news at all but simply another detail that proves that Moore is guilty. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama Breitbart continued. Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. So there you have it. Whether or not you believe the accusations against Roy Moore we now have undeniable proof that one of the main accusers with help from the liberal media publicly lied about her yearbook and then used ABC News to reveal her lie as if it were no big deal. Note: Remember when The Washington Post trotted out a former FBI expert who claimed there was no evidence that any portion of the yearbook was forged?! Courtesy of SHTFplan.com,,,0,0,,

(See evidence below.) (Follow all the news on Antifa at Antifa.news.) In August of this year we proclaimed that Antifa should be declared a domestic terrorism organization. Yahoo News a radical left-wing news cult staffed by delusional obedient left-wing propagandists went on to endorse the Antifa terrorist organization with a glowing review joining fake news leader CNN which also endorsed Antifa as part of its effort to destroy America and overthrow the results of a democratic election that put Trump into office. Not long after undercover footage caught Antifa terrorism operatives planning to trap conservatives in kill zones where they could be dispatched with deadly weapons. In just the last two years at least ten journalists have been violently assaulted by Antifa whackos and the owner of left-leaning Whole Foods now owned by Dr. Evil globalist Jeff Bezos began promoting and profiting from the sales of terror-inspired Antifa gear. (Yes Whole Foods is now part of the deranged radical Left just like the Washington Post and CNN) Many of Americas leftist universities are now well documented to function as terrorist recruitment hubs for Antifa terrorist groups and in September of 2017 the FBI and DHS finally officially classified Antifa as being engaged in domestic terrorist violence. One Antifa leader / recruiter has been identified as a college professor named Mike Isaacsonwho openly endorses dead cops. Note that Antifa leaders and members routinely and openly call for extreme acts of violence against police the government and Trump supporters often justifying their death demands by claiming violence is necessary to convert America to a left-wing communist nation by murdering those who oppose their radical political views. Any who oppose Antifa are labeled Nazis which is then used to justify their murder. Antifas history of railway sabotage now comes to light with these shocking facts Now in the aftermath of the deadly Amtrak derailment in Dupont Washington we have learned shocking facts that point to Antifas role in the deadly terrorism act that has spilled blood in Washington: Antifa sabotaged a train in Olympia Washington claiming the train was transporting fracking supplies. In true left-wing Antifa style 20 30 protesters reportedly camped out on the railroad tracks to disrupt rail transport. They then hailed the disruption as a victory for left-wing justice. This was all covered in The Olympian a local paper. The Washington Post a radical left-wing anti-America publisher also owned by globalist Jeff Bezos who owns the Whole Foods that profited from selling terrorist Antifa gear published a glowing review of Antifas domestic terrorism activities all but encouraging them to carry out more such acts. The Antifa-echoing website Puget Sound Anarchists bragged about sabotaging trains in Washington claiming During this week we attached wire and jumper cables to the main Union Pacific rail line running through the state of Nebraska to disrupt rail signals and delay trains that mainly carry coal from the mountainous west to population centers in the east. Inspiration for us came from the blockade in Olympia Unistoten camp in unceded Wetsuweten territory and other actions large and small across turtle island. until the complete destruction of time itself love and rage from the middle of nowhere bragged about sabotaging trains in Washington claiming During this week we attached wire and jumper cables to the main Union Pacific rail line running through the state of Nebraska to disrupt rail signals and delay trains that mainly carry coal from the mountainous west to population centers in the east.

In this article they claimed to have poured concrete on the tracks reports The Gateway Pundit.

They have since removed the post but it was originally found at this link. In typical left-wing rant fashion this website explained This action was done to disrupt the movement of trains carrying proppants used in natural gas fracturing. These train tracks are part of a system of pipelines fracking wells mines clearcuts control centers fiberoptics dams highways and factories that cover the planet and are physical manifestations of a process that is destroying the ecosystems cultures and inhabitants everywhere. near Olympia Washington.

It has since been deleted. #Amtrak pic.twitter.com/aHfwdSM1ce Far Left Watch (@FarLeftWatch) December 18 2017 The left-wing terror WAR on America has begun Through countless podcasts videos and articles Ive repeatedly warned that the radicalization of the Left in America would lead to deadly acts of sabotage and terrorism. Now it seems that war has begun in Washington where the derailment of this train in light of all the threats and sabotage that has been carried out by Antifa groups is no mere coincidence. Antifa has shifted to active domestic terrorism against Americas civilians. The insanity of left-wing universities and anti-Trump hysteria has reached a new level of extreme danger for innocent Americans. This derangement whipped up by the late-night lunatic Jimmy Kimmel and other TV hate speech entertainers is now placing all Americans in the path of the Lefts insatiable appetite for slaughter. Today its a commuter train tomorrow it may be a jumbo jet an airport or a sports stadium. There is no limit to what Antifa can justify carrying out as theyve already labeled any who oppose them fascists and therefore excused their murder. In this way the extreme Left in America has become a dangerous cult of deranged delusional maniacs who see themselves as revolutionaries who seek the rise of communism to overthrow this nations existing government. Just yesterday in fact BuzzFeeds U.K. science editor a completely deranged lunatic named Kelly Oakes tweeted All I want for Christmas is full Communism now. As TheWrap.com reported: A spokesperson for BuzzFeed declined to comment on the matter. Oakes who does not report to the websites U.S.-based science desk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Critics pointed out that Communism as practiced by the Soviet Union China and North Korea has led to the deaths of over 100 million people according to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. Keep in mind that this deranged lunatic is BuzzFeeds science editor! Yes to the Left being a mentally deranged lunatic does not necessarily disqualify anyone from commenting on climate change abortion or the genetics of biological gender. (Thats because the Left has completely abandoned all real science in favor of mob-mentality surges of screaming crybullies who make irrational demands while declaring they alone have a monopoly on consensus because of their sheer numbers.) Media outlets that encouraged and promoted Antifa The radicalized Left in America has become at best a hate group. At worst its now a terrorist organization. And it has long enjoyed the support of left-wing media organizations and internet giants including: Yahoo! News CNN Washington Post New York Times The Huffington Post MSNBC Google YouTube Facebook Twitter BuzzFeed These journo-terrorism organizations (and many more) continue to promote and encourage the maniacal violence of the deranged Left. From the recent irrational insanity over Net Neutrality to the outright hoax of Russia collusion with the Trump campaign the deranged Left has devolved into an organized hate group that has now spurred its most extreme members Antifa to carry out deadly acts of terrorism on U.S. soil. Should it be proven that the Amtrak derailment was a deliberate act of sabotage all these left-wing media outlets will have been complicit in these tragic deaths. They contributed to the hatred and even published glowing articles about Antifa terrorists while refusing to denounce their tactics of violence and destruction. Thats why Ive called the left-wing media journo-terrorism. Arrest all Antifa members nationwide: Round them up lock them up and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law If it is established that Antifa deliberately sabotaged that Amtrak train this realization should unleash a nationwide manhunt for all Antifa members and recruiters including the ones on college campuses across the country. Its time to arrest these domestic extremists and for once tell them that society will no longer tolerate their crybully tactics. All members of Antifa should be rounded up locked up and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law (which should now include the charge of murder for those directly involved in Washington). If the police need assistance in this process I have no doubt that millions of Americans would support activating the National Guard for this purpose. Some college campuses are truly terror recruiting hubs that need to be rooted out cleaned out and restored to institutions of higher education. We the People can no longer allow these deranged dangerous Leftists to go unchallenged as they attempt to carry out acts of mayhem and murder across this nation (in the name of justice of course). They must be identified arrested and imprisoned. These left-wing lunatics run the gamut from murderers to terrorists and they openly despise democracy liberty the U.S. Constitution and any person exhibiting political opposition to their left-wing fascist goals. In truth these anti-fascists are themselves todays most poignant echo of the Third Reich and its reign of terror over innocents. In their deranged quest to bring justice to America Antifa members have become the very thing they claim to despise: Genocidal fascists who are a threat to everyone else in a civilized society. Theres one thing American soldiers learned in World War II that should be remembered today: The way to deal with genocidal fascists is to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem make a plan of attack and go take them out until youve utterly destroyed their ability to continue operations. This needs to be done now in America or we may lose this country to actual communists who are meticulously working to overthrow this nation from within. Stay informed as this story unfolds. Here are some of the most important websites to keep reading. Avoid all mainstream media sites as they are now almost universally working with the terrorists and are deliberately publishing fake news every day: Antifa.news Covers Antifa actions and crimes. FarLeftWatch.com Documents the crimes and mass mental illness of the far left. TheGatewayPundit.com Probably the best political news site on the web today with a special knack for quickly exposing left-wing insanity. LeftCult.com Details the cult-like philosophies and activities of deranged Leftists.

The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for Juliet Manson from Glendale in California received a very special present from her mother for Christmas: a trip to China to undergo a breast augmentation surgery. The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for the last two years insisting she needed breast implants and begging for a surgery. Her mother Dana Manson says she tried to convince Juliet that her breasts would grow with time but her daughter was completely obsessed with the idea of getting breast implants. She would ask us multiple times a day every day she told NBC. There was nothing in the world that she wanted more than having boobs. Ms Manson even consulted a psychiatrist with her daughter hoping to rid Juliet of her obsession. The result however was very different from what she expected. After a dozen sessions with young girl the renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez concluded that she was suffering from a severe depression and had a serious lack of self-esteem and told her mother that a surgery could be beneficial. Doctor Ramirez says the young girl has developed some serious complexes about her appearance over the years and the operation will help her get an improved image of herself. Following the psychiatrists advice Ms Manson contacted dozens on clinics in the United States and Mexico but none of them were willing to perform a breast augmentation surgery on such a young girl. She finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China where doctors were willing to perform the operation. Dana Manson decided that she would go on the trip to Asia with her daughter over the holidays and that the surgery would count as her Christmas present. They left for China on December 22 and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned. The young girl now has a 30C cup and her mother says shes extremely happy about her about her new breasts. Dana Manson told NBC that like every mother in the world she wanted her children to be happy and that Juliet was clearly unhappy about not having any breasts. The young girls story caught the worlds attention after she posted several pictures of herself on her Instagram account only hours after the surgery instantly causing a storm of reactions on the social media. Many people are denouncing the Manson parents for allowing their daughter to undergo plastic surgery at such a young age while others are blaming her psychiatrist for his recommendation. Despite the critics Dana Manson says she did what was best for her daughter and insists that she has no regrets. she is not only one we also this,,,0,0,,

Please feel free to inquire about the final 3 percent which is fewer than 400 votes and cant possibly change the outcome at this point.

While Nelson did not specify exactly what she added to the inscription the text beneath Moores signature reads: ""12-22-77 Olde Hickory House. During her original press conference with Allred in November in which she made her original accusation Nelson read aloud and attributed the entire inscription to Moore including the date and location. ""He wrote in my yearbook as follows: To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas Christmas 1977 Love Roy Moore Olde Hickory House. Roy Moore DA"" she said. At the time Nelson did not admit to writing the date and name of the restaurant herself. The implication was that it had been written by Moore. Moore tweeted Friday ""Now she herself admits to lying."" In a brief statement Friday Moore campaign attorney Phillip Jauregi echoed the candidate saying ""What [Nelson and Allred] said [in November] was either a lie or what they said today was a lie and the voters are going to have to decide."" Moore has denied signing the yearbook and said he did not know Nelson at the time. Moore went on to become a judge and then the chief justice of the Alabama State Supreme Court. The Moore campaign has questioned the authenticity of the inscription since the claim surfaced last month. During a press conference in Atlanta on Friday Nelson and Allred stood by their claim that Moore himself inscribed a message in the yearbook. But Allred acknowledged the last part including the date and location was written by Nelson. Beverly indicates she added that to remind herself of who Roy Moore was and where and when Mr. Moore signed her yearbook Allred said. Allred said a handwriting expert named Arthur T. Anthony determined that the signature is Moores and released a report of his findings. I want everyone to know that I stand by my previous statement that Roy Moore sexually assaulted me Nelson said. Last month the Moore campaign demanded that a handwriting expert be allowed to review the yearbook. Release the yearbook so that we can determine is it genuine or is it a fraud Jauregui said at the time. He repeated that demand Friday afternoon. Moore 70 is running against Doug Jones in a bruising special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions who President Trump named attorney general and then held on an interim basis by Luther Strange. The election is Tuesday. The Nelson accusation had bolstered claims by other women that Moore sought relationships with teenage girls in the late 1970s. Leigh Corfman claims Moore molested her when she was 14. Another woman claims Moore groped her in his office in 1991. An update to this story reflects that Beverly Young Nelson admits writing what ABC News characterized as notes beneath what she says is Roy Moores signature and that the only notes below the signature are the date and location. Furthermore the headline on story now specifies that Nelson admits to writing part of the inscription herself rather than forging part of it.

Bombshell: Roy Moore Accuser Beverly Nelson Admits She Forged Yearbook Breitbart ^ | December 8 2017 | John Nolte Posted on by Trump20162020 Beverly Young Nelson has finally admitted that she forged a portion of the infamous high school yearbook that she and attorney Gloria Allred used as proof of her accusations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore. And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription.

The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for Juliet Manson from Glendale in California received a very special present from her mother for Christmas: a trip to China to undergo a breast augmentation surgery. The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for the last two years insisting she needed breast implants and begging for a surgery. Her mother Dana Manson says she tried to convince Juliet that her breasts would grow with time but her daughter was completely obsessed with the idea of getting breast implants. She would ask us multiple times a day every day she told NBC. There was nothing in the world that she wanted more than having boobs. Ms Manson even consulted a psychiatrist with her daughter hoping to rid Juliet of her obsession. The result however was very different from what she expected. After a dozen sessions with young girl the renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez concluded that she was suffering from a severe depression and had a serious lack of self-esteem and told her mother that a surgery could be beneficial. Doctor Ramirez says the young girl has developed some serious complexes about her appearance over the years and the operation will help her get an improved image of herself. Following the psychiatrists advice Ms Manson contacted dozens on clinics in the United States and Mexico but none of them were willing to perform a breast augmentation surgery on such a young girl. She finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China where doctors were willing to perform the operation. Dana Manson decided that she would go on the trip to Asia with her daughter over the holidays and that the surgery would count as her Christmas present. They left for China on December 22 and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned. The young girl now has a 30C cup and her mother says shes extremely happy about her about her new breasts. Dana Manson told NBC that like every mother in the world she wanted her children to be happy and that Juliet was clearly unhappy about not having any breasts. The young girls story caught the worlds attention after she posted several pictures of herself on her Instagram account only hours after the surgery instantly causing a storm of reactions on the social media. Many people are denouncing the Manson parents for allowing their daughter to undergo plastic surgery at such a young age while others are blaming her psychiatrist for his recommendation.

On Thursday Boykin shared hisplansto reach out to the United Nations Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Support Oscar Fernandez-Taranco toseek helpwith horrific levels of shootings in the city of Chicago. If the organization were to step in it would mark the first time a U.N. peacekeeping mission was implemented on American soil. While on his way to New York to meet with Fernandez-Taranco Boykinsaid: Im hoping to appeal to the U.N. to actually come to Chicago and meet with victims of violence and maybe even possibly help out in terms of peacekeeping efforts because I think its so critical for us to make sure that these neighborhoods are safe. Boykin went on to say that Chicagos leaders have failed to protect these neighborhoods from themselves. There is a quiet genocide taking place in too many of our communities. Eighty percent of those who are being killed by gun violence are African American and often killed at the hands of another African American. So we must protect these population groups and thats what the United Nations does. Theyre a peacekeeping force. They know all about keeping the peace and so were hopeful that theyll hear our appeal. Boykin thenelaboratedon what he hopes the U.N. might accomplish in the city: Theyve been able to help in places like Africa and abroad where theyve sent troops in and sent forces in to help protect minority and vulnerable populations and so quite frankly I think the same can be said for here in Chicago. Im talking about physical security. Im also talking about maybe suggestions for what we can do in Chicago to help protect our minority populations. Were being again decimated by the violence that we see here in Chicago. I mean this is really a genocide and we have to do something to stop it. It is unclear whether Boykin understands the actualdefinitionof genocide. Mayor Rahm Emanuel did not respond directly to Boykins plans but didhighlightrecent though small improvements in crime statistics while adding he has plans to guaranteepeople feel a sense of security. Chicago is no stranger to such overbearing suggestions. In January Donald Trump posted atweetthat has been liked 205000 times. The president of the United States threatened tosend in the Fedsin response to the gun violence in Chicago. The tweet had talking headsdiscussingthe possibility of sending in the National Guard in to deal with the citys violence. Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner quicklyrespondedby saying that such an extreme decision would be a mistake. Nevertheless the main solution the city appears to endorse merely adds more police power to a region already inundated with a heavy police presence known forviolatingresidents rights. In September Chicagos Community Development Commission approved a 30.4-acre land acquisition a step in the process of building an enormous multi-million dollarpolice training centeron the citys West Side a move that local residents have found bizarre and misdirected. Despite the surging violence on the streets of Chicago and the staggeringsegregationthat disenfranchises too many Chicagoans the fact remains that U.N. Peacekeepers are typicallydeployedto war zones where they deal with terrorist groups rebel fighters and ethnic militias none of which are present in Chicago.,,,0,0,,

For one whats wrong with the notation to begin with? In 1979 men could write notes like this without being accused of perversion. It could merely have been done out of kindness. Looking into past actions through todays lens is difficult. Another problem is who is this expert. We never heard of him. He could be Allreds cousin for all we know. Lastly how do we know the date of this notation now and how does the expert know Roy Moore wrote it for certain? What exactly did he do to verify put the information out there for all to see. Did this expert date the ink? The fact is Nelson appears dishonest and presented the entire written exchange as Moores until yesterday. Some photos show the ink of one color. The women may all be telling the truth but why should we just believe anyone without due process? Get an independent expert or shut up Allred!

At least two of Nelsons family members one her stepson said she was lying about the entire incident. Her testimony was key because she said shed testify under oath she claimed he tried to assault her and she bolstered all the other accusations bringing them to a whole new level. People already suspected it was a forgery. It would be nice to know if Allred and CNN and ABC News were in on the lie. Why didnt they have this checked by an expert before reporting? Notice that the first report from CNN showed two different ink colors.

He also said Those initials as well as the date under the signature block and the printed name of the restaurant are written in a style inconsistent with the rest of the yearbook inscription. The 7s in Christmas 1977 are in a noticeably different script than the 7s in the date 12-22-77. I believe tampering has occurred.

From Breitbart: Beverly Young Nelson has finally admitted that she forged a portion of the infamous high school yearbook that she and attorney Gloria Allred used as proof of her accusations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore. And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding ""notes"" to the inscription.

""But the message was all Roy Moore."" ""Beverly he signed your yearbook"" ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. ""He did sign it"" she replies. ""And you made some notes underneath."" ""Yes"" Nelson says. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence. Llamas also fails to ask any follow-ups such as ""If the explanation is this simple why wait all these weeks to offer it?"" Or ""Why did you lie?"" Nelson is accusing Moore of attempting to assault her when she was just 16-years-old. With the election just four days away this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for Moore. Nelson and Allred are planning a news conference Friday but nothing will overcome the forgery admission. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama. Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. Now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore. One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfmans living a troubled life of ""drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt"" is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. Thanks to New Medias going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moores office ""on business."" If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an ""unfit absent and unstable mother."" If the media and the accusers and Gloria Allred told the full truth to begin with they would all be more credible. As far as the accusations against Moore involving his wanting to date teenage girls those are trumped-up charges utter nonsense. The age of consent in Alabama was and is 16. Moreover 40 years ago it was not at all uncommon in the South for a 32-year-old man to seek a much younger bride. So not only did Moore not break the law he was not violating any social mores. I dont know whats more shocking her fraud finally being revealed or ABC News Llamas glossing over it and coaching her through her admission as though its a non-story. One look at the signature made it clear it was a fraud: She used a blue ink to add the entire right portion including the ""Moore"" part. ""Olde Hickory House"" is a completely different handwriting. The entire right section is also misaligned. This is fraud for which she should be criminally prosecuted along with Gloria Allred. NBC News reported on November 17th: Nelsons lawyer Gloria Allred said her client is willing to testify under oath before the U.S. Senate that there has been no tampering. If such a hearing is held she is will to submit the yearbook to an independent examiner to have it tested Allred added in an email to NBC News. Is Roy Moore willing to step down from his race for the Senate seat if we can prove that what appears to be written by him is authentic?

Susan Collins and Jeff Flake (Zachary Leeman LifeZette) Its hard to believe Rosie ODonnell was once considered a comedian. Shes been so consumed by anti-Trump hysteria for the past year or more that her Twitter account suggests someone devoid of any sense of humor at all and someone unaware of the exaggerated and bloated nature of her statements. Nearly every tweet relates back to the president. She continually beats the fear-mongering drums and promotes the notion that absolutely every piece of legislation that passes is another sign of the apocalypse. The recent tax bill approved by the Senate (and to be voted on against today by the House) was no different. ODonnell believes the sky is falling and she was so desperate to stop it that she took to Twitter to offer money to Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Jeff Flake to vote against the bill. She offered $2 million to them to be exact. So the person saying a tax cut for many Americans will be the end of days has millions of dollars to spare? Its hard to tell if ODonnell is aware of irony at this point in time. **MORE COVERAGE OF HOLLYWOOD LUNACY at LibertyHeadlines.com** Bribery is also illegal under federal law. Perhaps the comedian was joking. Perhaps it was all some lame attempt at satire meant to make some larger tired point about politicians being bought and paid for. This seems like wishful thinking since ODonnells social media is so humorless and she seems so constantly and desperately obsessed with the president. Here are some recent tweets from her account: Trump critics like ODonnell appear to center their lives around the president far more than even his most ardent supporters do. In case anyone needed any more proof about ODonnells mindset remember this is the same person who suggested martial law to prevent the president from taking office; the same person who needed to apologize for cyberbullying 11-year-old Barron Trump; the same person who has been caught spreading fake news about Trump; and the same person even Saturday Night Live felt has gone too far in her Trump criticism.

The ship which was supposed to be carrying emergency supplies was actually carrying a cargo that had authorities stunned. BPA Harbormaster Jake Cummings explained to CNN: We received a tip that the Clinton Foundation flagship The Chelsea was carrying illegal contraband into the United States. We honestly didnt know what to expect but what we found was simplysurreal. In the middle of the ships large manifest of containers most of which were empty we found 14 containingpeople. Yes people. They were all Refugees from places like Yemen and Syria and not a single one had any kind of documentation. We interviewed those who spoke English and were told that for $40K anyone can catch a ride to the United States on a ship nobody would ever suspect. Immigration was immediately called and found that of the 460 people on board illegally not one had been through any kind of vetting process. After running the men through facial recognition they found more than a dozen suspected terrorists who are on the US no-fly list. Those men were about to be unleashed on the public for $40K each. A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation denied that the Foundation was involved and promised that they would get to the bottom of the situation. Two other containers were also found to contain multiple crates of contraband including illegal fruits that could potentially carry foreign insects and foodborne illnesses weapons without serial numbers on them and no less than 30 pounds of marijuana. Several of the refugees were also found to be in possession of black tar heroin an addictive smokable form of the drug. Surely the Clintons will manage to weasel their way out of any charges but at least for now their ships are on the radar. The Foundation said it will recall all 11 of its boats for inspection as soon as they finish their current missions.,,,0,0,,

Julia Roberts was speaking on the New York set of her new film as principal photography began on the drama Ben Is Back. Michelle Obama paid a visit to the film production while in the vicinity and Julia Roberts agreed to meet her however she opened up about the differences between Americas most recent First Ladies as soon as Michelle left the set. Melania has her priorities straight and she is a great example for our young women Julia Roberts said. Michelle? Talk about a wolf in sheepskin. The news comes days after Julia Roberts slammed Celine Dion for criticizing the POTUS and stating that she hates America. I cant even look at an American flag anymore. I hate this country Canadian Celine Dion said while complaining about the Trump presidency. Youre wrong Celine Julia Roberts fired back. The America we know and love was destroyed by Obama and his disastrous presidency. If you disagree you can always go back to your own country. In fact perhaps you really should. Celine Dion was one of dozens of liberal celebrities who threatened to leave the United States and return to their homelands if America elected Donald Trump as president. So far a grand total of zero of these liberal celebrities have followed through with their threat to leave. The sheer hypocrisy makes it hard to believe they really feel as strongly as they claim about Trump. Its all hot air and virtue signaling from the celebrity contingent on the left. source:trending-info,,,0,0,,

The State Attorneys Division of Integrity in Elections is calling the acts of the women a blatant disregard for the duties of civil servants a violation of the public trust and a 2nd-degree felony. Wanda Werkmeister Olivia Pertuiary and Maureen Brown will all face charges of conspiracy to contribute to widespread voter fraud and violation of the public trust both punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a million dollars in fines. Roy Moores campaign on the news that voter fraud was rampant in Birmingham and all of Applevale County is standing by at the door of the clerks office to the 17th District Federal Court of Appeals to file an injunction against a single vote from the Democrat stronghold to be counted. Pundits on both sides are speculating that the outcome will almost certainly be a Roy Moore win. Sean Hannity speaking as a guest on Dana Loeschs new show Guns God and Grits said: Without that inner-city ghetto vote Doug Jones doesnt have a chance. It doesnt make much sense why someone from the citys vote is so much more important to Democrats who swear they arent at all racist.

In the city of Tokyo (Japan) the first restaurant in the world that legally offers Humana meat was inaugurated. A scary restaurant nicknamed The Resoto ototo no shoku ryohin which means in English Edible Brother opened its doors to the Japanese public and from all over the world where it offers its customers a varied menu where prices vary from 100 up to 1000 euros that is to say the dish with human flesh more expensive would be 1193 US dollars. International news sources have reported that a tourist from the country of Argentina was the first man to eat human flesh in the Edible Brother. This diner I think the following: It seems like eating pork in this restaurant they cook the meat with spices so the taste goes unnoticed. In Japan since 2014 a law was approved that allows the consumption of human flesh obviously conserving conditions such as the sanitary level of this and the origin. However there is no doubt that at least 99% of the world population would not agree with these grotesque acts so to speak. And the question we all ask ourselves how do they get the meat? The people before dying decide to sell their bodies to the peculiar restaurant approximately for about 30 thousand euros or 35799 dollars this is the balance that those interested can leave their families logically they are the only ones who can claim the money. Only people who die young can sign the contract in which they are subject to a special diet where the meat is suitable for consumption. And would you be willing to sell your body to be consumed after your death?,,,0,0,,

Different color ink. Inconsistencies with the signature. The DA label even though Roy Moore wasnt D.A. at the time. The fact Gloria Allred refused to let an expert look at it. It didnt add up. On Friday the story completely blew up. The great John Nolte has the details. From Breitbart: Beverly Young Nelson has finally admitted that she forged a portion of the infamous high school yearbook that she and attorney Gloria Allred used as proof of her accusations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore. And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence.

The rest of Noltes piece explains the many many inconsistencies with the allegations but this revelation makes it abundantly clear that this yearbook entry was forged. She admitted to messing with it. Thats pretty much all the evidence we need. Here is more from Nolte. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore. One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14 year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfman living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (The Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. This media narrative is crumbling fast. Are we really supposed to believe that these allegations just magically appeared out of nowhere from 40 years ago right before the election as a total coincidence? Roy Moore has been around for decades and no one brought this up. All of a sudden right before the election hes a monster? You really have to suspend disbelief to buy this story. Yes if he did those things with a 14-year-old hes a bad guy. But its not even remotely a fact he did that. So many of these allegations against Moore have been exposed as just ridiculous. Remember when everyone was running around saying Moore was banned from a mall as if that was a fact? It wasnt a fact and it now actually looks false. Joel Pollak wrote a great piece about how the allegations against Moore arent adding up. Why does only Breitbart seem to care about the truth here? Why are so many people willing to just believe whatever the mainstream media tells them on this?,,,0,0,,

The incident took place around 8:30 this morning in the Allen Morris Dog Park in Miami. According to witnesses 4-year old Spanky was playing with his owner in the park when Mister Sanchez grabbed him and attempted to rape him. The male pit bull violently resisted and severely injured its attackers legs arms and groin. The dog was just running around playing with a ball when the man came out of nowhere and tried to grab it says Dorothy Steinberg a witness of the events. The man had his pants down and was struggling with the dog. Everyone in the park was just stunned and nobody did anything but the dog defended itself and bit back. In a matter of seconds he grabbed the mans genitals with its teeth and literally tore them apart. And this is not the 1st case below its video from last October.,,,0,0,,

After climbing into the room of the 3 and 6-year-old sisters James got more than he bargained for when familys Pit Bull Terrier leaped to the girls defense. The dog severed the rapists genitals clean off and swallowed his penis and testicles. The commotion alerted the childrens parents who called emergency services. According to the father of the children after calling the police the attacker was in so much pain that he didnt attempt to make an escape. James was rushed to the hospital where doctors treated his wounds but said they were unable to rescue his genitalia after it had been swallowed by the dog. Hospital staff said they were able to patch him up and while he lost a lot of blood and was clearly in a lot of pain he would survive. They added that although his injuries were no-longer life-threatening they were certainly life-altering. The family who cant be named said they are just thankful their dog was there to protect the young girls from the attacker. The mother of the girls said: Hes our hero. Hell be eating steak for a week now. Local residents described the incident which happened around 2 am on Monday as being very unusual for the neighborhood. One neighbor said they always leave windows open at night saying we never worry about something like this happening around here. Another local resident described being awoken by the screaming during the incident I think it woke everyone in the neighborhood up. Ive never heard anything like it. Blood-curdling screams that sounded like something from a horror movie. It must have lasted 20 minutes. When I heard what happened I thought no wonder! Then I thought good. Good doggy. Lt. Dodson of the Saline County Sherrifs Office said in a statement said the family was lucky their pet was able to protect them from a potential sexual assault adding: A man entered a family home with unlawful intentions and luckily their family dog was able to prevent a serious attack from taking place.

Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 Beverly Young Nelson admitted to ABC News that she added notes beneath what she says is Roy Moores signature in her high school yearbook an inscription that she and famed attorney Gloria Allred presented as proof the then-30-something Moore sought an inappropriate relationship with her in the late 1970s. The notes below the signature appear to be the handwritten date and location. Nelson still insisted that Moore wrote most of the message. Beverly he did sign your yearbook? ABCs Tom Llamas asked her. He did sign it she said. And you made some notes underneath? Llamas asked. Yes she replied. While Nelson did not specify exactly what she added to the inscription the text beneath Moores signature reads: 12-22-77 Olde Hickory House. During her original press conference with Allred in November in which she made her original accusation Nelson read aloud and attributed the entire inscription to Moore including the date and location. He wrote in my yearbook as follows: To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas Christmas 1977 Love Roy Moore Olde Hickory House. Roy Moore DA she said. At the time Nelson did not admit to writing the date and name of the restaurant herself. The implication was that it had been written by Moore. Moore tweeted Friday Now she herself admits to lying. In a brief statement Friday Moore campaign attorney Phillip Jauregi echoed the candidate saying What [Nelson and Allred] said [in November] was either a lie or what they said today was a lie and the voters are going to have to decide. Recusal in Russia case sends intrigue into overdrive Moore has denied signing the yearbook and said he did not know Nelson at the time. Moore who went on to become a judge and then the chief justice of the Alabama State Supreme Court later ruled against Nelson in a 1999 divorce case. The Moore campaign has questioned the authenticity of the inscription since the claim surfaced last month. During a press conference in Atlanta on Friday Nelson and Allred stood by their claim that Moore himself inscribed a message in the yearbook. But Allred acknowledged the last part including the date and location was written by Nelson. Beverly indicates she added that to remind herself of who Roy Moore was and where and when Mr. Moore signed her yearbook Allred said. Allred said a handwriting expert named Arthur T. Anthony determined that the signature is Moores and released a report of his findings. I want everyone to know that I stand by my previous statement that Roy Moore sexually assaulted me Nelson said. Media Losing Mind Over How Sarah Says Shes Treated as Woman in Trumps White Last month the Moore campaign demanded that a handwriting expert be allowed to review the yearbook. Release the yearbook so that we can determine is it genuine or is it a fraud Jauregui said at the time. He repeated that demand Friday afternoon. Moore 70 is running against Doug Jones in a bruising special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions who President Trump named attorney general and then held on an interim basis by Luther Strange. The election is Tuesday. The Nelson accusation had bolstered claims by other women that Moore sought relationships with teenage girls in the late 1970s. Leigh Corfman claims Moore molested her when she was 14. Another woman claims Moore groped her in his office in 1991. An update to this story reflects that Beverly Young Nelson admits writing what ABC News characterized as notes beneath what she says is Roy Moores signature and that the only notes below the signature are the date and location. Furthermore the headline on story now specifies that Nelson admits to writing part of the inscription herself rather than forging part of it.,,,0,0,,

Multiple fatalities were reported after Amtrak train 501 derailed about 7:30 a.m. along Interstate 5 as it was leaving the new Tacoma station Pierce County Sheriffs Spokesman Ed Troyer said. He did not specify the number of people killed. The train was traveling southbound from Seattle when it derailed. Police previously said several cars were struck by the Amtrak train cars injuring multiple drivers on the highway. No motorists deaths were reported according to Pierce County officials. This from earlier in the year from Dangerous.com: Antifa anarchists blockaded the Port of Olympia in Washington for 12 days from November 17 to 29 until police forced them to evacuate. Their actions inspired another group to sabotage a railroad in Oregon. The city was unable to negotiate the anarchists peacefully so it sent the police in to negotiate with them the hard way. The group of anti-fracking protesters built a makeshift encampment to block railroad tracks in downtown Olympia. The group opposed the Port of Olympias shipping of fracking sand which is used to extract oil and natural gas. Police took action against the anarchists following complaints from a railroad company issuing verbal warnings before entering the camp which police say was empty by the time officers moved in according to a report on the Olympian. Police dogs were also brought in to search for explosives near the railroad tracks. According to the report around two dozen protesters many of whom covered their faces sang songs and mocked police as they protected public crews clearing the camp. Police pushed back protesters who tried to advance toward the camp but made no arrests. No injuries were reported. Fast forward to the horrific derailment that we see today.

The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for the last two years insisting she needed breast implants and begging for a surgery. Her mother Dana Manson says she tried to convince Juliet that her breasts would grow with time but her daughter was completely obsessed with the idea of getting breast implants. She would ask us multiple times a day every day she told NBC. There was nothing in the world that she wanted more than having boobs. Ms Manson even consulted a psychiatrist with her daughter hoping to rid Juliet of her obsession. The result however was very different from what she expected. After a dozen sessions with young girl the renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez concluded that she was suffering from a severe depression and had a serious lack of self-esteem and told her mother that a surgery could be beneficial. Doctor Ramirez says the young girl has developed some serious complexes about her appearance over the years and the operation will help her get an improved image of herself. Following the psychiatrists advice Ms Manson contacted dozens on clinics in the United States and Mexico but none of them were willing to perform a breast augmentation surgery on such a young girl. She finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China where doctors were willing to perform the operation. Dana Manson decided that she would go on the trip to Asia with her daughter over the holidays and that the surgery would count as her Christmas present. They left for China on December 22 and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned. The young girl now has a 30C cup and her mother says shes extremely happy about her about her new breasts. Dana Manson told NBC that like every mother in the world she wanted her children to be happy and that Juliet was clearly unhappy about not having any breasts. The young girls story caught the worlds attention after she posted several pictures of herself on her Instagram account only hours after the surgery instantly causing a storm of reactions on the social media. Many people are denouncing the Manson parents for allowing their daughter to undergo plastic surgery at such a young age while others are blaming her psychiatrist for his recommendation. Despite the critics Dana Manson says she did what was best for her daughter and insists that she has no regrets.

In the city of Tokyo (Japan) the first restaurant in the world that legally offers Humana meat was inaugurated. A scary restaurant nicknamed The Resoto ototo no shoku ryohin which means in English Edible Brother opened its doors to the Japanese public and from all over the world where it offers its customers a varied menu where prices vary from 100 up to 1000 euros that is to say the dish with human flesh more expensive would be 1193 US dollars. International news sources have reported that a tourist from the country of Argentina was the first man to eat human flesh in the Edible Brother. This dinner I think the following: It seems like eating pork in this restaurant they cook the meat with spices so the taste goes unnoticed. In Japan since 2014 a law was approved that allows the consumption of human flesh obviously conserving conditions such as the sanitary level of this and the origin. However there is no doubt that at least 99% of the world population would not agree with these grotesque acts so to speak. And the question we all ask ourselves how do they get the meat? The people before dying decide to sell their bodies to the peculiar restaurant approximately for about 30 thousand euros or 35799 dollars this is the balance that those interested can leave their families logically they are the only ones who can claim the money. Only people who die young can sign the contract in which they are subject to a special diet where the meat is suitable for consumption. And would you be willing to sell your body to be consumed after your death? Credits: blackvines,,,0,0,,

Beverly he signed your yearbookABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence. Nelson is accusing Moore of attempting to assault her when she was just 16-years-old. With the election just four days away this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for Moore. Nelson and Allred are planning a news conference later Friday but nothing will overcome the forgery admission. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama. Another problem with Nelson is that she has motive to lie and forge as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. The Moore campaign have been pressuring Nelson and Allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. Now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore. One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14 year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfman living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (The Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. Thanks to New Media going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moores office on business. If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12 year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was a unfit absent and unstable mother. If the media and the accusers and Gloria Allred told the full truth to begin with they would all be more credible. As far as the accusations against Moore involving him wanting to date teenage girls those are trumped up charges utter nonsense. The age of consent in Alabama was and is 16. Moreover 40- years-ago it was not at all uncommon in the South for 32-year-old man to seek a much younger bride. So not only did Moore not break the law he was not violating any social mores.

And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence the Breitbart report continued. This is about as transparent as it gets. ABC News attempted to have Nelson reveal the stunning fact that she forged part of the yearbook inscription as if it were not news at all but simply another detail that proves that Moore is guilty. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama Breitbart continued. Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. So there you have it. Whether or not you believe the accusations against Roy Moore we now have undeniable proof that one of the main accusers with help from the liberal media publicly lied about her yearbook and then used ABC News to reveal her lie as if it were no big deal. Note: Remember when The Washington Post trotted out a former FBI expert who claimed there was no evidence that any portion of the yearbook was forged?!,,,0,0,,

The Bermuda Triangle Bermuda Triangle does not need any introduction. If you ever read anything upon the biggest unsolved mysteries in the world I am sure Bermuda Triangle wouldve topped that list! It is famous for sucking in (mysteriously) anything and everything that comes in its area. Right from flights to ships everything has lost its way in here. But what happened recently might just be the curse breaker for this scary place. 2. The Reappeared Ship Apparently something happened that this Triangle is not really known for. A ship that was lost recently reappeared magically behind the winds within the waves. Well this is no joke my friends. On a very serious note a ship just reappeared mysteriously out of nowhere. 3. Was First Spotted On The Cuban Coast Guard announced that they had intercepted an unmanned ship heading for the island which is presumed to be the SS Cotopaxi a tramp steamer which vanished in December 1925 and has since been connected to the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. See told yll I was serious! This ship was first spotted on May 16 near a restricted military zone west of Havana by the Cuban authorities! They made many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the crew and finally mobilised three patrol boats to intercept it. 4. When It First Vanished On 29 November 1925 the SS Cotopaxi departed Charleston South Carolina and headed towards Havana Cuba. The ship had a crew of 32 men under the command of Captain W. J. Meyer and was carrying a cargo of 2340 tons of coal. It was reported missing two days later and was unheard of for almost 90 years. When the ship was first lost no one mustve imagined that itll reappear 90 years later in such condition. But to everyones surprise it did! 5. The Investigation The Vice President of Council of Ministers General Abelardo Colome announced that the Cuban authorities were going to conduct a thorough investigation to elucidate the mystery of the ships disappearance and reappearance. After this incident the scientists are already excited about the new pattern of research theyll conduct in the area. Lets wait an watch if some more missing things resurface back in this area! Hopefully! h/t: hindiantribe.us Comments,,,0,0,,

Sandy King (@SandyK812) December 20 2017 18 U.S. Code 201 Bribery of public officials and witnesses is pretty clear in defining this crime. Any attempt to influence a public officials public act with an offer of something of value is bribery and a felony. ODonnell offered 4 million dollars which is something of value to get two Senators who are public officials to vote against a tax bill which is a public act. Shes guilty as hell of this. [] The punishment for attempting to bribe a public official is up to 15 years in prison and a fine of three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value. Since she offered 2 million to each senator thats 6 million a piece or 12 million total. But it gets more interesting since she also offered any Republican senator the same deal. There are 52 Republican Senators and at 2 million each that makes 104 million times 3 which is 312 million. In addition shed be looking at 52 cases of trying to bribe a public official so she could also face 780 years in prison.

After climbing into the room of the 3 and 6-year-old sisters James got more than he bargained for when familys Pitt Pull Terrier leaped to the girls defense.The dog severed the rapists genitals clean off and swallowed his penis and testicles. The commotion alerted the childrens parents who called emergency services.According to the father of the children after calling the police the attacker was in so much pain that he didnt attempt to make an escape.James was rushed to the hospital where doctors treated his wounds but said they were unable to rescue his genitalia after it had been swallowed by the pet bulldog.Hospital staff said they were able to patch him up and while he lost a lot of blood and was clearly in a lot of pain he would survive. They added that although his injuries were no-longer life-threatening they were certainly life-altering.The family who cant be named said they are just thankful their dog was there to protect the young girls from the attacker.The mother of the girls said: Local residents described the incident which happened around 2 am on Monday as being very unusual for the neighborhood.One neighbor said they always leave windows open at night saying we never worry about something like this happening around here.Another local resident described being awoken by the screaming during the incident: I think it woke everyone in the neighborhood up.Ive never heard anything like it.Blood-curdling screams that sounded like something from a horror movie.It must have lasted 20 minutes.When I heard what happened I thought no wonder! Then I thought good. Good doggy.Lt. Dodson of the Saline County Sherrifs Office said in a statement said the family was lucky their pet was able to protect them from a potential sexual assault adding: A man entered a family home with unlawful intentions and luckily their family dog was able to prevent a serious attack from taking place.We are currently investigating a complaint of an attempted sexual assault and will be taking a suspect into custody as soon as he has recovered from his injuries.The dog has yet to pass the attackers genitals after swallowing them but the family said theres no rush; he wont need them now.,,,0,0,,

Julia Roberts was speaking on the New York set of her new film as principal photography began on the drama Ben Is Back. Michelle Obama paid a visit to the film production while in the vicinity and Julia Roberts agreed to meet her however she opened up about the differences between Americas most recent First Ladies as soon as Michelle left the set. Melania has her priorities straight and she is a great example for our young women Julia Roberts said. Michelle? Talk about a wolf in sheepskin. The news comes days after Julia Roberts slammed Celine Dion for criticizing the POTUS and stating that she hates America. I cant even look at an American flag anymore. I hate this country Canadian Celine Dion said while complaining about the Trump presidency. Youre wrong Celine Julia Roberts fired back. The America we know and love was destroyed by Obama and his disastrous presidency. If you disagree you can always go back to your own country. In fact perhaps you really should. Celine Dion was one of dozens of liberal celebrities who threatened to leave the United States and return to their homelands if America elected Donald Trump as president. So far a grand total of zero of these liberal celebrities have followed through with their threat to leave. The sheer hypocrisy makes it hard to believe they really feel as strongly as they claim about Trump. Source: 50statereport.com,,,0,0,,

Or Why did you lie?Nelson is accusing Moore of attempting to assault her when she was just 16-years-old. With the election just four days away this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for Moore. Nelson and Allred are planning a news conference Friday but nothing will overcome the forgery admission.How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama.Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case.The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. Now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored.With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore.One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfmans living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context.Thanks to New Medias going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moores office on business. If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an unfit absent and unstable mother.If the media and the accusers and Gloria Allred told the full truth to begin with they would all be more credible.As far as the accusations against Moore involving his wanting to date teenage girls those are trumped-up charges utter nonsense. The age of consent in Alabama was and is 16. Moreover 40 years ago it was not at all uncommon in the South for a 32-year-old man to seek a much younger bride. So not only did Moore not break the law he was not violating any social mores.,,,0,0,,

Jesus Ramon Sanchez from the Little Havana neighborhood in Miami was allegedly attempting to engage in sexual intercourse with a 4-year old male pit bull when the dog defended itself by tearing off the mans genitals with its teeth. The incident took place around 8:30 this morning in the Allen Morris Dog Park in Miami. According to witnesses 4-year old Spanky was playing with his owner in the park when Mister Sanchez grabbed him and attempted to rape him. The male pit bull violently resisted and severely injured its attackers legs arms and groin. The dog was just running around playing with a ball when the man came out of nowhere and tried to grab it says Dorothy Steinberg a witness of the events. The man had his pants down and was struggling with the dog. Everyone in the park was just stunned and nobody did anything but the dog defended itself and bit back. In a matter of seconds he grabbed the mans genitals with its teeth and literally tore them apart. And this is not the 1st case below its video from last October .

Simply listen to her latest uncontrolled rant on Twitter where she publicly bribed two Republican legislators to change their vote for the sum of $2-million. The incident took place Tuesday night when the former funny lady took to Twitter and offered both Susan Collins (R-ME) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) the bribe if they would cast a no vote on the impending Trump Tax Bill that would benefit over 80% of taxpayers allowing them to keep more of their own money. ODonnell like most progressive Ideologues was already feeling the burn as the GOPs historic tax bill won the approval of both the House and Senate (on a party-line vote) and it was just a matter of time before she completely lost it by first tweeting out the bribe offer; so how about this I promise to give 2 million dollars to Senator Susan Collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NONO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUPER RICH ODonnell continued: DM me Susan DM me jeffno shit 2 million cash each. so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 susan 2 million dollars cash call if u want to negotiate do u think your family is proud of u @sennatorcollins woman mother grandmother sister daughter u have betrayed us all dear god ask for forgiveness redeem ur soul tomorrow #NOTSEXIST pic.twitter.com/wa0QcMXNk2 ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Now as most critical thinking individuals have already concluded offering a bribe to a member of Congress to change their vote is a federal crime under title 18 USC which in part states; Whoever directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public officer or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity with intent to influence any official actshall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value whichever is greater or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years or both and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor trust or profit under the United States.

Proving the organization had been involved in a historical cover-up of evidence showing giant human remains in the tens of thousands that were uncovered across America that were ordered to be destroyed by upper-level administrators to ensure protection of the mainstream chronology of human evolution in that time. Allegations were made by the American institution of Alternative Archaeology (AIAA) that the Smithsonian Institution had destroyed thousand so giant human remains during the early 1900s wasnt taken so well by the Smithsonian who reacted by suing the organization for defamation and the damage of the 168-year old institution. During the court case new evidence was brought in as several Smithsonian whistle blowers admitted to the existence of documents that allegedly proved the destruction of tens of thousands of human skeletons reaching between 6 feet and 12 feet in height a reality mainstream archeology can not admit to for different reasons claims AIAA spokesman James Churward. There has been a major cover up by western archaeological institutions since the early 1900s to make us believe that America was first colonized by Asian peoples migrating through the Bering Strait 15000 years ago when in fact there are hundreds of thousands of burial mounds all over America which the Natives claim were there a long time before them and that show traces of a highly developed civilization complex use of metal alloys and where giant human skeleton remains are frequently found but still go unreported in the media and news outlets he explains. A turning point of the case was when a 1.3 meter long human femur bone was shown as evidence in court of the existence of such giant human bones. The evidence came as a blow to the Smithsonians lawyers as the bone had been stolen from the Smithsonian by one of their high level curators in the mid 1930s who had kept the bone all his life and admitted on his deathbed in writing of the undercover operations in the Smithsonian. It is a terrible thing that is being done to the American people he wrote in his letter. We are hiding the truth about the forefathers of humanity our ancestors the giants who roamed the earth as recalled in the Bible and ancient texts of the world. The US Supreme Court has forced the Smithsonian Institution to publicly release all classified information about anything related to the destruction of evidence pertaining to the mound builder culture and to elements relative to human skeletons of greater height than usual a ruling the AIAA is highly enthusiastic about. The public release of these documents will help archaeologists and historians to reevaluate current theories about human evolution and help us greater our understanding of the mound builder culture in America and around the world explains AIAA director Hans Guttenberg. Finally after over a century of lies the truth about our giant ancestors shall be revealed to the world he acknowledges visibly satisfied by the court ruling. Those documents are set to be revealed to the public in 2017 and the operation will be conducted by an independent scientific organization to ensure political neutrality.

She made that perfectly evident Tuesday night when she offered to buy the votes of a couple of Republican senators. Directing a tweet at moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) and retiring Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) ODonnell offered up some serious coin for a ""no"" vote on the tax bill. ""so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no s**t 2 million cash each"" she wrote. Collins and Flake apparently turned down the monetary offers voting in favor of the bill which was expected to become law on Wednesday. Now ODonnell is being accused of violating federal bribery laws with her tweet. The law states that someone is guilty of bribery who directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official in exchange for an action such as a vote. It all rides on what her intent was in writing that tweet NYU Law School professor Rebecca Roiphe told the New York Daily News. ""And trying to buy influence isnt the point of this whole string of these tweets. What shes trying to do is fake-offer a bribe to point out that theyve already been politically been bought.

It would be easier to accept NASAs official explanation if they were not so secretive about everything they study and do in space but one thing is for certain NASAs own personnel have admitted that lithium along with other chemicals are intentionally being placed into our environment regularly. It is possible that many of NASAs own employees arent even aware of the true motivations for carrying out such a project ironically displaying the very behaviors that these chemicals/pharmaceuticals are meant to instill. In the first bomb-shell video a NASA employee ( Douglas.e.rowland@nasa.gov) admits that lithium is being sprayed in the atmosphere and says that it is harmless to the environment. Before I give you NASAs official explanation of why they are spraying psych-meds over hundreds of thousands of Americans Id like to point you to some references so that you can do your own research and discover that this is no conspiracy theory. It is very real and there is ample scientific documentation to corroborate what I put forth here: A Pub Med abstract titled Feasibility of Aerosol Vaccinations in Humans discusses how an increase in antigen volumes can be beneficial in aerosol delivery of vaccines and could be used in developing countries and disaster areas. The abstract also admits that several thousand human subjects have already been aerosol vaccinated with live attenuated measles and influenza A vaccines. The executive summary further states that aerosol vaccinations are ideal for large populations. This has apparently been happening since as early as 2003. Another discussion of aerosolized vaccinations can be found in The New England Journal of Medicine. A Randomized Controlled Trial of Aerosolized Vaccines Against Measles states that these vaccines were tested on children in India that were as young 9 months old. The World Health Organization has been researching aerosol vaccines for years now as have philanthropic agencies which have clear aims to sterilize the population. It is also worth noting that the pharmaceutical industry has been absolved from any legal responsibility for medicating the masses since they were awarded legal protection from all lawsuits by Congress in 1986. This law was challenged but upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011. Many powerful agencies are making sure that we take our medicine. In fact many nations are participating in our unwitting forced vaccination and the dumping of any number of attenuated viruses chemical concoctions and other chemtrails on our heads with dogged frequency. The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) considered giving a license application to PaxVax Australia (PaxVax) for the intentional release of a GMO vaccine consisting of live bacteria into the environment in Queensland South Australia Western Australia and Victoria. They planned to release cholera on their people. According to the regulator this GMO vaccine qualified as a limited and controlled release under section 50A of the Gene Technology Act 2000. Of course we cant ignore the USA. Michael Greenwood wrote an article stating that: The incidence of human West Nile virus cases can be significantly reduced through largescale aerial spraying that targets adult mosquitoes according to research by the Yale School of Public Health and the California Department of Public Health. So hopefully weve established that this IS happening. But why? As more nations refuse genetically modified food and refuse to drink fluoridated water which has been named as a neurotoxin by one of the worlds premiere medical journals the power structure that desires a complicit population has to figure out a way to alter our neurochemistry. READ: NASA Takes Chemtrail Spraying Program to Outer Space Lithium alters how we think by changing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine secreted by our endocrine system. Lithium strongly alters the brain system yet the NASA employee in the above video states that it is not dangerous and doesnt harm the population. Even doctors who normally prescribe this medication for the mentally ill have said that it is dangerous because it is hard to figure out proper dosing. Surely spraying copious amounts of lithium indiscriminately into the air via aerosols should be questioned but heres NASAs official stance on this practice: The project is studying neutral and charged particles in the ionosphere and how each affects the way the other moves resulting in currents in the region. The variations matter because all of our communications and GPS satellites send signals through the ionosphere. A disturbed ionosphere translates to disturbed signals so scientists want to know just what causes the ionosphere to behave in specific ways. (NASA) Meanwhile should the over-medicated start to actually figure out what is being done to them the government has imposed gag orders on the National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) who might easily refute the ridiculous claims of NASA. Notably every single person who works for NASA the NWS or NOAA are paid with tax payer dollars. This means that we are paying to be medicated and poisoned. Here to corroborate information being given by the NASA employee in the video is the Code 8440 RMMO which states the exact purpose of using Wallops Flight Facility to launch a rocket containing lithium thermite: Purpose: The primary purpose of this mission was to test the loading methods for lithium canisters to be flown on the upcoming Kudeki (Kwajalein April 2013) and Pfaff (Wallops June 2013) missions and verify their functionality under sounding rocket launch and space flight conditions. Rocket Type: Two-stage Terrier MK70 Improved-Orion Location: Wallops Range Launcher: MRL Date of Launch: January 29 2013 Time: 17:50 EST Experiment results: Thermistor data looked nominal. Good report from airborne optical platform of recorded video and lithium clouds also visible by ground observation. We also learn from this specific call that lithium has been dumped in our skies since 1970. If you wanted to medicate the masses to create mindless slave-like prisoners who didnt even know they were imprisoned this is surely a good way to do it. Spraying lithium into our skies along with countless other bacteria viruses prions parasites fungi carcinogens toxins hormone-altering drugs anti-flora and anti-fauna as well as gene-altering micro-dust is nothing more than bio-warfare against the worlds citizenry. You can call them chemtrails or something else the effect is the same. The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed our minds are molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. In almost every act of our daily lives whether in the sphere of politics or business in our social conduct or our ethical thinking we are dominated by the relatively small number of personswho understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind. ~ Edward L. Bernays Master Propagandist Read more articles by Christina Sarich.

Olde Hickory House sat right off of the four-lane highway and had a wrap-around porch with lights all around it. Nelson claimed that the surroundings were dark and isolated. Rhonda Ledbetter who worked at Olde Hickory House for almost 3 years states that the earliest it closed was at 11 p.m. but she believes it was open until midnight .

She is certain it did not close at 10:00 because Goodyear was next door and employees came to eat when their shift ended at 10 p.m. It is unlikely that there was an entrance from the back of the parking lot which Nelson claimed existed . Multiple sources have claimed that everyone parked on the sides of the building because there wasnt much room behind the restaurant according to Rhonda not enough room to turn around. Renee Schivera stated that a neighborhood backed up to the parking lot and it was adjacent to the backyards of peoples houses so she did not see how there would have been a back entrance as it would have gone through someones yard. . Multiple sources have claimed that everyone parked on the sides of the building because there wasnt much room behind the restaurant according to Rhonda not enough room to turn around. Nelson claimed that Judge Roy Moore came in almost every night and sat at the counter but former employees state that customers at the counter were served by the bartender or short order cook not served by the waitresses and had no reason to interact with the wait staff. Additionally two former waitresses and two former patrons state they never saw Judge Moore come into the restaurant. Other Moore accusers have been called out As Radio host Mark Levin pointed out on his show last week that there are several aspects of the case which dont really make sense. To recap; a Washington Post reporter overheard a rumor at a Roy Moore event in Alabama about Moore sexually abusing four girls 38 years ago then found the women interviewed them and the rest is history. Levin raised the following questions: How did the WaPo reporter know there were four women who they were and how to contact them? How is it that the reporter happened to overhear a rumor about four women who dont know each other and have never met yet the anonymous source the WaPo reporter ran into happened to know each girls story and how to contact them? yet the anonymous source the WaPo reporter ran into happened to know each girls story and how to contact them? Why hasnt any of this been reported in Moores 38 years in politics? And why now - a month before an important election to fill Jeff Sessions senate seat? Adding to the list of questionable circumstances is the revelation that one of Moores accusers Debbie Gibson worked as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and is actively campaigning for Moores Democrat opponent Doug Jones. As New York Times bestselling author Attorney and Law professor James Hirsen points out: The Washington Post failed to disclose that one of Moores accusers was a sign language interpreter for Joe Biden and is a volunteer for Moores Democrat opponent. James Hirsen (@thejimjams) November 10 2017 Heres Gibson hard at work for Hillary: Another Moore accuser Leigh Corfman has claimed ""several pastors at various churches made sexual advances at her."" This 3x divorcee who has also filed for bankruptcy three times. Purportedly Moores main accuser Leigh Corfman has had three divorces filed for bankruptcy three times and has been charged with multiple misdemeanors. Posts on Moores FB page indicate that Corfman has claimed several pastors at various churches made sexual advances at her. James Hirsen (@thejimjams) November 10 2017 The Star reports: She says that her teenage life became increasingly reckless with drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt when she was 16. As the years went on Corfman says she did not share her story about Moore partly because of the trouble in her life. She has had three divorces and financial problems. While living in Arizona she and her second husband started a screen-printing business that fell into debt. They filed for bankruptcy protection three times once in 1991 with $139689 in unpaid claims brought by the Internal Revenue Service and other creditors according to court records. In 2005 Corfman paid a fine for driving a boat without lights. In 2010 she was working at a convenience store when she was charged with a misdemeanor for selling beer to a minor. The charge was dismissed court records show. The WaPo reporter who penned the article wrote fake check according to an 2011 Red State report Ms. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown. Ms. McCrummens criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654 a violation of the Article 19 False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code. Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless.

Soros had been complaining of severe indigestion and foggy thinking in the early hours of the day according to reports and began to feel unwell while meeting staff in the new faculty building announcing that the hand of God has seized me by the neck. Dismissing suggestions he was reacting badly to his traditional Christmas Eve lunchtime meal Soros staggered outside in search of fresh air before collapsing just outside the gymnasium of the Central European University. The globalist billionaire who recently donated $18 billion to international liberal causes collapsed against a wall before slumping to the ground where he was found lying on his side whimpering softly. Quick-thinking actions by trained gymnasium staff saved Soross life and expert CPR helped the 87-year-old billionaire survive and avoid brain damage according to reports in Hungarys liberal media. After 15 minutes of CPR the paramedics arrived and took over. Soros was given the defibrillator three times and they managed to restart his heart and take him to a private residence where he where he underwent triple coronary artery bypass surgery. Soross private heart specialist has reportedly given the worlds most generous donor to leftist causes just over 33% chance of survival and warned the octogenarian he may require an Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) in his chest to regulate his heart. The cardiac arrest has sparked fears in liberal circles for the Hungarian-American financial speculator. Neither the Soros family or the Open Society Foundation has publicly comment on George Soross condition.,,"7m6363,7m4a14,",4,33,"ConspiracyFacts,conspiracy,","PostNationalism,MarmadukeHammerhead,"

The Bermuda Triangle Bermuda Triangle does not need any introduction. If you ever read anything upon the biggest unsolved mysteries in the world I am sure Bermuda Triangle wouldve topped that list! It is famous for sucking in (mysteriously) anything and everything that comes in its area. Right from flights to ships everything has lost its way in here. But what happened recently might just be the curse breaker for this scary place. 2. The Reappeared Ship Apparently something happened that this Triangle is not really known for. A ship that was lost recently reappeared magically behind the winds within the waves. Well this is no joke my friends. On a very serious note a ship just reappeared mysteriously out of nowhere. 3. Was First Spotted On The Cuban Coast Guard announced that they had intercepted an unmanned ship heading for the island which is presumed to be the SS Cotopaxi a tramp steamer which vanished in December 1925 and has since been connected to the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. See told yll I was serious! This ship was first spotted on May 16 near a restricted military zone west of Havana by the Cuban authorities! They made many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the crew and finally mobilized three patrol boats to intercept it. 4. When It First Vanished On 29 November 1925 the SS Cotopaxi departed Charleston South Carolina and headed towards Havana Cuba. The ship had a crew of 32 men under the command of Captain W. J. Meyer and was carrying a cargo of 2340 tons of coal. It was reported missing two days later and was unheard of for almost 90 years. When the ship was first lost no one mustve imagined that itll reappear 90 years later in such condition. But to everyones surprise it did! 5. The Investigation The Vice President of Council of Ministers General Abelardo Colome announced that the Cuban authorities were going to conduct a thorough investigation to elucidate the mystery of the ships disappearance and reappearance. After this incident the scientists are already excited about the new pattern of research theyll conduct in the area. Lets wait an watch if some more missing things resurface back in this area! Hopefully!,,,0,0,,

And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription. Worse still the reporter actually coaches Nelson puts words in her mouth downplay the enormous significance of her deceit. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription ABC News tells us. But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbook ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence. Llamas also fails to ask any follow-ups such as If the explanation is this simple why wait all these weeks to offer it? Or Why did you lie? Nelson is accusing Moore of attempting to assault her when she was just 16-years-old. With the election just four days away this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for Moore. Nelson and Allred are planning a news conference Friday but nothing will overcome the forgery admission. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama. Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. Now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore. One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfmans living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. Thanks to New Medias going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moores office on business. If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an unfit absent and unstable mother. If the media and the accusers and Gloria Allred told the full truth to begin with they would all be more credible. As far as the accusations against Moore involving his wanting to date teenage girls those are trumped-up charges utter nonsense. The age of consent in Alabama was and is 16. Moreover 40 years ago it was not at all uncommon in the South for a 32-year-old man to seek a much younger bride. So not only did Moore not break the law he was not violating any social mores.

ODonnell broke the law when she offered to pay two Republican lawmakers for voting against Trumps tax cut bill on Twitter. Even offering this is illegal. You are not above the law but I guess you are since the Feds havent been knocking on your door. with all these tweets you obviously are not joking. Androgynous Priest (@AndrogynPriest) December 21 2017 After ex-comedian Rosie ODonnells meltdown on Twitter before the Senates big tax vote Tuesday night President Donald Trump can reasonably direct federal authorities to lock her up and even to take some money out of her fat-ass pockets which he once infamously cited as a personal goal. Starting a few hours before the legislation passed ODonnell tweeted: so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Even after another Twitter user Louise Mensch replied that ODonnell was irresponsibly advocating bribery ODonnell doubled down. i disagree it is obvious there is a price corker had one collins too flake almost brave he crawled out backwards 2 million to any GOP senator who votes no on KILLING AMERICANS MILLIONS WITH OUT HEALTH CARE MY GOD HAVE WE NO SO ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Federal law addresses ODonnells actions. 18 U.S. Code 201 criminalizes the attempted bribery of federal officials by whoever directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official with intent to influence any official act. The penalty? For Rosie she could spend up to 15 years in jail suffer a lifetime ban from elective office and pay up to a cool $12 million: The statute calls for a fine of not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value whichever is greater or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years or both and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor trust or profit under the United States. In court ODonnell would probably argue that her attempted bribe was in jest or perhaps a syndrome of a mental illness. After all her attorneys would argue who while seriously attempting to bribe members of the U.S. Congress would do so in such a reckless public manner that would all but ensure a conviction? Daily Caller The emboldened screwball doubled down on her vile tweets calling for people to rise up against our government and mobilize to call 911 and again offered to pay US Senators millions of dollars to vote against tax cuts for working American families. WE CANNOT SIT AT HOME WHILE THEY ROB OUR NATION YOUR NEIGHBORS HEALTH CARE FOR THE FUCKING MERCERS AND KOCH BROTHERS FUCK THEM RISE UP ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 She even asked her followers to call 911 to report a fake crime. There has to be a law against this: call 911 crime in progress US SENATE this is too much ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 What does Rosie mean when she calls on people to mobilize against our government? Isnt that the same thing as calling for a coup? Isnt that also considered to be illegal?

Sanders took to his allies in the media to call on President Trump to resign over unproven allegations of sexual misconduct that were made against him during his campaign. By the way it should not go without mentioning that we havent heard a peep from any of Trumps accusers since he won the election. The Democrats are not going to give up that easily when it comes to ousting President Trump. Just this week Democrats gave up the fight for Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) and Senator Al Franken (D-MN) (both of whom represented safe districts for Democrats) after multiple allegations of sexual assault and abuse. It was a clear play at attempting to convince voters that the Democrats are suddenly the party of morals. Do Democrats really believe Americans will be duped into believing that the party who cheated Bernie Sanders (who wrote about how women fantasize about being gang-raped) out of the chance to be the Democrat nominee for President to make Hillary Clinton (a woman who has been accused of enabling her accused rapist husband who has also been accused several times of sexual assault and was impeached for lying about having sex with a 19-year old intern under his desk in the Oval Office) is somehow now the moral party? Heres what Bernie had to say about President Trump yesterday: Washington Examiner We have a president of the United States who acknowledged on a time widely seen all over this country that he assaulted women so I would hope that maybe the POTUS might pay attention to whats going on and also think about resigning Sanders told CBS News on Thursday. Bernie recently said it was not up to the Senate or Democrat Party to call on Senator Franken to step down. Watch as Sanders glosses over the question when asked about his previous statement (before Democrats decided Franken was a scalp they could spare for the sake of the party). ""What I worry about right now as we speak in restaurants and in offices all over this country where you have bosses who are not famous there is harassment of women and women are being intimidated. We need a cultural revolution in this country."" @SenSanders pic.twitter.com/GTxAf0PVGA CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) December 7 2017 Watch Sanders (the presumtive leader of the Democrat Party) as he calls on President Trump to step down: ""We have a POTUS who acknowledged on a tape widely seen all over the country that hes assaulted women so I would hope maybe the president of the United States might pay attention of whats going on and also think about resigning."" @SenSanders pic.twitter.com/fy4ucYUEkv CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) December 7 2017 The senator was referencing a tape from Access Hollywood made public during the 2016 election on which the president was heard talking about grabbing women without their consent. More than a dozen women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Several of Sanders colleagues in Congress have been accused of inappropriate behavior and Sen. Al Franken D-Minn. is expected to make a speech on the Senate floor addressing the allegations against him late Thursday morning. Speaking of words Trump used decades ago when referring to a woman during a private conversation with another man what about the disgusting and degrading essay Bernie Sanders wrote about women in 1972? Daily Wire A 1972 essay written by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) expressed his views on human sexuality in which he claimed that women fantasize about being gang-raped and men fantasize about sexually abusing women. The article Man and Woman came to light after Mother Jones published it during the 2016 presidential election before Sanders started to gain significant momentum in the race. Sanders piece was originally published in the Vermont Freeman and was a reflection on his views of gender and sexuality the Washington Examiner reported. The first two-paragraphs in Sanders article drew the most controversy: A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees a woman tied up a woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously. Sanders was 31 years old at the time he wrote the essay and had just launched his first campaign for Senate which proved to be the first of several losing campaigns before he became mayor of Burlington nine years later.

She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfmans living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. Thanks to New Medias going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moores office on business. If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an unfit absent and unstable mother. If the media and the accusers and Gloria Allred told the full truth to begin with they would all be more credible. Here are close up versions of the signatures. Note that when viewed close up the signature is signed in both black and blue ink. Here is a closer version of the yearbook signature: Here is Wictors explanation for the different colors of ink: (4) The LIGHT is reflecting off of the ink. The ink that LOOKS blue is actually black. Its DIFFERENT ink than the ORIGINAL ink. Therefore it reflects light differently. Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 16 2017 (11) So to recap: The signature is a forgery and everything after the name ""Roy-Ray"" was added later with different ink. pic.twitter.com/1sPv6aABge Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 15 2017 Just like the ""TH"" doomed Dan Rather ""DA"" will doom the anti Roy Moore forces.

It served as evidence that Roy Moore is a pedophile. But it seemed fishy. Some things didnt add up. Different color ink inconsistencies with the signature the D.A. label eve though Roy Moore wasnt D.A. at that time and the fact that Gloria Allred refused to let an expert to look at this. This Friday the story blew up. Beverly Young Nelson has finally admitted that she forged a portion of the infamous high school yearbook that she and attorney Gloria Allred used as proof of her accusations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore. And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence.

Whatever credibility she had just went down in flames. One of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moores accusers admitted that the yearbook she claims he signed was slightly doctored during a Friday interview with ABC News.

Heres the CNN link where you can see the that the location and date added is in the same ink as the last name and D.A. So obviously shes lying about that. She added the last name and the D.A. as well as the ink shows. Why couldnt MSM investigate the very apparent two different color inks? The reason Nelson added D.A. despite the fact that he wasnt the D.A. was that he had handled her divorce and signed her order with D.A. at end of his name. His assistant added D.A. to denote that she was signing orders on his behalf. So she was consciously imitating his signature. Who would allow a judge to handle her divorce if hed tried to attack her? And one more thing. This also calls into question another accuser Debbie Wesson who said Moore dated her when she was 17 and he wrote her a note then. But the signature on her note appears identical to the one that appears to have been added by Nelson. So that raises a question about whether thats real either. Simple answer? Date the ink.

The Bermuda Triangle Bermuda Triangle does not need any introduction. If you ever read anything upon the biggest unsolved mysteries in the world I am sure Bermuda Triangle wouldve topped that list! It is famous for sucking in (mysteriously) anything and everything that comes in its area. Right from flights to ships everything has lost its way in here. But what happened recently might just be the curse breaker for this scary place. 2. The Reappeared Ship Apparently something happened that this Triangle is not really known for. A ship that was lost recently reappeared magically behind the winds within the waves. Well this is no joke my friends. On a very serious note a ship just reappeared mysteriously out of nowhere. 3. Was First Spotted On The Cuban Coast Guard announced that they had intercepted an unmanned ship heading for the island which is presumed to be the SS Cotopaxi a tramp steamer which vanished in December 1925 and has since been connected to the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. See told yll I was serious! This ship was first spotted on May 16 near a restricted military zone west of Havana by the Cuban authorities! They made many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the crew and finally mobilized three patrol boats to intercept it. 4. When It First Vanished On 29 November 1925 the SS Cotopaxi departed Charleston South Carolina and headed towards Havana Cuba. The ship had a crew of 32 men under the command of Captain W. J. Meyer and was carrying a cargo of 2340 tons of coal. It was reported missing two days later and was unheard of for almost 90 years. When the ship was first lost no one mustve imagined that itll reappear 90 years later in such condition. But to everyones surprise it did 5. The Investigation The Vice President of Council of Ministers General Abelardo Colome announced that the Cuban authorities were going to conduct a thorough investigation to elucidate the mystery of the ships disappearance and reappearance. After this incident the scientists are already excited about the new pattern of research theyll conduct in the area. Lets wait an watch if some more missing things resurface back in this area!

Source: Breitbart If the yearbook inscription is not to be taken at face value (and really how can we now that shes admitted this?) is there anything else this could cast a reasonable doubt upon? Especially since Gloria Allred has staunchly refused to submit the yearbook to an independent professional for handwriting analysis? This is the same woman whos making claims that Moore attempted to assault her when she was sixteen. Is there any possible motive that might make her willing to present a false story that would be damaging to him? According to the same Breitbart article: as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. Surely we arent the only ones who think this could *possibly* influence a persons motives are we? As for the other accusers? If the accused only requires reasonable doubt the same article makes some observations about problems with the testimony there too. Morality requires that we take claims and accusations seriously. Thats obvious. But what it it doesnt require is that we blindly believe all accusations especially when we have some means to test the facts they claim. And so far considering the severity of the accusations being leveled and the powerful political motivations at play in this year of the medias own self-proclaimed resistance there are some pretty significant unanswered questions.

Ben Shapiro calls her out and the exchange was fan-freaking-tastic! Rosie violated federal law by offering bribes to sitting senators to vote the way she wanted them to on the tax bill 18 USC 201(b). (See below) She got called out by conservatives on Twitter. The best responses however were given by former Breitbart Editor and current Editor of the Daily Wire Ben Shapiro: We have to use screenshots with all of Rosies tweets because she often gets Twitter Regret when she gets called out. The one below has already been deleted. To which Shapiro responded: And then capped it perfectly: And when she got called out she reacted poorly: That was just more fodder for Shapiro: So was President Trump right about Rosie? Watch this and decide: Heres the backstory. In a twist that surprises no one a radical leftist tries to use her cash to bribe senators to vote with her ideological agenda. I swear were not making that up. Rosie ODonnell made a public offer to bribe GOP Senators Susan Collins and Jeff Flake with mucho dinero if they vote against the tax bill. She offered to write them a cheque for $2 million each. You realize what this means dont you? Its official President Trump has broken Rosie ODonnell. Shes completely lost her mind. I give you the screenshots of her Twitter feed as proof. Now Im not sure what she means by SOUER rich. If Rosie hadnt blocked me on Twitter Id probably ask if she meant Sewer rich like the swamp rats in Washington that somehow make gazillions while working for the taxpayers or the ones in Hollywood that turned a blind eye while Weinstein harassed groped and raped his way through the talent pool. Or perhaps she meant the Sewer rich that would offer cash to Senators to change their vote. Rosie watches nutty Rachel Maddow and then GOES ALL CAPS: Her followers start asking if this is for real: A semi-reasonable response from a Rosie follower right? Not to Rosie. She goes full-nutter and ENDS WITH ALL CAPS: No so? No soy? Soy latte? What the hell is she saying? Ill bet even she doesnt know. See heres the thing maybe Democrats work that way having their palms greased but we expect better from Republicans. Wow. It must be horrible to be Rosie ODonnell. I mean thats true in general but under the Trump administration it must be just painful getting up in the morning wondering when the Apocalypse will come. I have a prediction: 2020 when President Trump is reelected. As for the Is that legal? part of the headline quick answer is No. Heres the relevant portion of 18 USC 201(b): Rosie violated federal law with her tweet. Rosie perhaps you should read this related ClashDaily article: Dear NeverTrumpkins: Trump Has Made Our Government More Moral How Does Crow Taste? You obviously need a lesson on right and wrong. You know what will happen if she reads that though dont you? And that will get messy because you know whats in there right?

Trump Derangement and Romney Derangement before that and Bush Derangement before that are only the tip of the iceberg. What is driving them so berzerk?

Violence in the city has reached a point that will no longer be tolerated by authorities. Martial law has been declared over the nations third largest city according to the website Neon Nettle. The city affectionately called Chiraq accounts for more homicides than active warzones. The city itself is beginning to resemble a warzone with the appearance of heavily armed men with face coverings marching down the street in stride with giant armored vehicles. The vehicles themselves and the armament being carried resemble that of the United Nations peace keeping forces. There has been little to no news coverage about the emergence of an occupying military force arriving on American soil. One local radio personality Matt Dubiel attempted to cover the events on his radio show. Radio station WCKG 1530 AM operations were shut down almost immediately after Dubiel made mention of eye witness reports describing troops on the ground from an Alex Jones segment. The DJ believes the moment after the vehicles were identified as United Nations the radio station was taken off the air. Matt Dubiel claims to have been followed and then arrested after witnessing the arrival of the military equipment. On September 29 2015 the Department of Justice arranged along with several major metropolitan cities to initiate a global police force. The program titled The Strong Cities Network was showcased as an anti-terror network aimed at defeating domestic extremism. During a United Nations General Assembly then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced retinue of cities across the United States to be included. Some of the original cities include Los Angeles Denver Atlanta Minneapolis New York and San Diego. Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin traveled to New York to address the United Nations on Thursday December 14th. The commissioner met with officials from the United Nations pleading for help to address the gruesome crime rate for Chicago. In his meeting with the assistant secretary-general for peace building support Boykin voiced his concern for the need of a peace keeping force in lieu of the national guard. Calling the situation a quiet genocide the commissioner said he could not wait for the citys mayor Rahm Emanuel to put another thousand officers on the streets. He continued to second guess the mayor pondering if that would be the right answer to the problem. When asked how United Nations peace keepers were different from the forces of the national guard Boykin responded that the national guard is not trained for peace keeping operations. After his meeting last week the United Nations announced they would send top officials into the city to address the situation. In early September footage was taken of a sizeable number of United Nations assets held in Hagerstown Maryland. Just outside of Washington D.C. large white crates stamped with the letters UN block the view from the fence onto the installation. Using a drone images were taken of over 50 heavily armored vehicles and various pieces of equipment. All of the vehicles are completely white and stamped with the letters UN. The vehicles range from single transport trucks to armored caravans. There are fuel carriers and cargo vans. Small engineering vehicles for clearing roads and what appears to be an RV are all on the lot. The equipment including generators and cranes seem more than sufficient enough to supply a small army. The peace keeping materials were found behind a government owned warehouse. Sitting in the rear parking lot the vehicles appear poised for a rapid response in a domestic deployment. Could the officials of Chicago been planning to implement martial and import an occupying force to combat President Trump? The vehicles witnessed in Chicago resemble the peace keeping forces stationed in Maryland. The vehicles in Illinois however are all black and have no visible writing on them. The forces alongside the vehicles are not typical blue hat U.N. personnel. Drabbed in all black the forces have no identifying print on their combat garb. Chicago is a sanctuary city. Mayor Emanuel has vowed the city is a Trump free zone and scoffed at the offer to have the national guard intervene in the vapid battlegrounds. Emanuel wants to put another thousand officers on the streets and implement after school programs for kids. Not mentioning how to pay for these programs Rahm Emanuel has also acclaimed the great success of the citys efforts so far. Chicagos death toll is down 15% from last year 624 and 734 homicides respectively.,,,0,0,,

She later extended that offer to any Republican senator who would take her up on it. But some said on social media it appears she violated federal law and could face up to 15 years in prison if she were actually convicted. Jeff Jacoby a conservative columnist at the Boston Globe tweeted: Heres a fun fact @Rosie: Under 18 U.S. Code 201 offering $4 million in bribes to senators to influence a vote is punishable with up to $12m in fines and/or imprisonment for as much as 15 years.

One person suggested to Markay that ODonnell could face 30 years in prison: 30 years actually. She offered it to two officials. Thats two counts. Eric Wagner (@NotEricWagner) December 20 2017 Technically if one considers she eventually offered it up to all GOP senators present that would raise the sentence even higher. Since 51 Republicans voted for the measure one could argue that ODonnell technically faces up to 765 years in prison.

Accompanied by attorney Gloria Allred Nelson claimed that Moore informed her at the time that he was the District Attorney and he signed her yearbook. But author and Twitter thread genius Thomas Wictor said on the social media site the signature in that yearbook was forged. (35) Two accusers say Moore approached them during Christmas of 1977. My guess is they said that so that it would align with the yearbook message. pic.twitter.com/qdSTBkjcE5 Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 14 2017 Unless Moores handwriting has changed the yearbook signature is a forgery he said on Twitter.

Look at the two versions of the number ""7."" pic.twitter.com/dn4z1dMiUe Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 14 2017 Another Twitter user also saw the discrepancy: Additionally Wictor said the restaurant where Nelson said the alleged incident took place was forged. Old Hickory House in Gadsden was never called Olde Hickory House. The person who forged the signature got the name wrong.

But theres more. According to Breitbart Nelson said Moore told her at the time You are just a child and I am the District Attorney of Etowah County; if you tell anyone no one will believe you. But Wictor and others observed Moore wasnt the District Attorney. At the time he was serving at the Deputy District Attorney: I SAW THAT TOO. The accuser to this day calls him the District Attorney. He was NEVER District attorney. He was DEPUTY DA.

AND things are looking bad for his accusers Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 14 2017 Wictor went on to poke a number of holes into the allegations made against Moore on his Twitter feed. The Moore campaign pre-emptively responded to the allegations Breitbart said with a statement issued by campaign Chairman Bill Armistead: Gloria Allred is a sensationalist leading a witch hunt and she is only around to create a spectacle. Allred was the attorney who claims credit for giving us Roe v. Wade which has resulted in the murder of tens of millions of unborn babies. Weve said this before and well say it again: Judge Moore is an innocent man and has never had any sexual misconduct with anyone. This is a witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character. Let it be understood: the truth will come forward we will pursue all legal options against these false claims and Judge Moore will be vindicated. Breitbart added: A prominent plaintiffs attorney and proponent left-wing social causes for decades Allred also pursued a lawsuit against then-presidential candidate Donald Trump representing three women who claimed last year that he sexually assaulted them. Around the same time the suit was filed Allred was also serving as a delegate for Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention. Moore responded to the allegations saying he doesnt know the woman making the claim: Thank yall for being here tonight. Thank-you to all the people have came out at this late hour and for being here. I want to address whats been brought out on television today by Gloria Allred and a client she has about things I allegedly did. I want to make it perfectly clear the people of Alabama know me they know my character they know what Ive stood for in the political world for over 40-years. I can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false. I never did what she said I did. I dont even know the woman. I dont know anything about her. I dont even know where the restaurant is or was. If you look at this situation youll see because Im eleven or ten points or eleven points ahead this race being just 28 days off that this is a political maneuver and has nothing to do with reality. Its all about politics. ""I can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false. I never did what she said I did. I dont even know the woman"" said Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore who was responding to Beverly Young Nelsons allegations of sexual assault. pic.twitter.com/23DUsuvYkW CBS News (@CBSNews) November 14 2017 Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he believes the accusations and has called on Moore to step aside. Moore however said McConnell is the one who should step down: The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell. He has failed conservatives and must be replaced. #DrainTheSwamp Judge Roy Moore (@MooreSenate) November 13 2017 As we reported earlier Moore has indicated he intends to take legal action against the Washington Post. Will he also go after Allred and her client?

It served as evidence that Roy Moore is a pedophile. But it seemed fishy. According to our source America News Hub some things didnt add up. Different color ink inconsistencies with the signature the D.A. label eve though Roy Moore wasnt D.A. at that time and the fact that Gloria Allred refused to let an expert to look at this. This Friday the story blew up. Beverly Young Nelson has finally admitted that she forged a portion of the infamous high school yearbook that she and attorney Gloria Allred used as proof of her accusations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore. And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore. One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14 year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfman living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (The Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context Breitbart reported. Geez. Even if shes telling the truth about that still being Moores signature (and I still believe it is) this is bad for her story. Should have disclosed. Shouldnt have hired Gloria Allred. https://t.co/AqgSVCNlCV Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) December 8 2017 Why the hell would Allred not have advised her to a.) admit up front that she wrote the date and location under Moores signature to memorialize it and b.) immediately submit it for handwriting analysis? Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) December 8 2017 Its funny how all these accusations came up right before the election. He has been around for decades and no one brought this up.

Mary Lynne Davies who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines. The revelation came after the yearbook inscription that Moore supposedly wrote in the 1970s turned out to be a forgery. Davies who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. Her attorney says she sticks by her story: My clients main concern is that because of the yearbook thing nobody will believe her story. She fabricated the yearbook because nobody would listen in the first place. Shes a victim and now shell be prosecuted while her abuser goes to the US Senate. Nothing about this is right. Nothing. Nothing about this is wrong jerk. Justice Moore is a fine upstanding man who has shown time and time again that he loves America and our family values. He deserves to be exonerated.

Due to take office in January Ravi Bhalla received a Christmas gift from the current mayor Dawn Zimmer: a chance to make one mayoral decree at the annual Christmas gala at the Patrick C. Farley Community Center on 5th and Brussels. Bhalla and Zimmer shook hands then Bhalla shocked the roughly 200 citizens in attendance with his decree that the word Christmas shall not be said at government functions. Zimmer looked as shocked as everyone else but she reluctantly agreed that she would keep her word and that no public officials in Hoboken were permitted to use that word in an official capacity. According to the Hoboken Journal the event was closed to the public and journalists were not permitted to bring cameras and our incoming mayor is probably glad of that. The crowd began to boo loudly and one man was escorted out after throwing a souffle at Bhallas head knocking his turban off the Journal reports. Eventually things returned to normal but there was a sense of displeasure the rest of the evening. This war on Christmas has gone on long enough. Liberals need to learn that this is a Christian nation and nothing means more to us than our liberty than our God.

Date rapes have become frighteningly common as people with evil intent slip drugs into unsuspecting womens drinks. How can anyone feel safe knowing that every drink at the bar is a gamble? But thats about the change all thanks to a common beauty item with a cool scientific twist. Four young men have designed and come up with a kind of nail polish that can actually alert girls if their drinks have been spiked. They did so due to being sick and tired of rape culture and the unsafe situations a woman can be placed in due to creeps. So how on earth can nail polish do this? Its surprisingly simple! The nail polish is made from ingredients that allow it to change color when they come into contact with roofies or other date rape drugs. One finger gently dipped into a drink will trigger a reaction and color switch if the drink contains a drug. Remarkable! The nail polish is not being put into commercial mass production as of yet and of course it is never the victims responsibility to prevent rape. However this product has the potential to be a fantastic help to saving the lives of women around the world. As men experience rape too there is the possibility of a clear version of this nail polish becoming available in the future! This incredibly invention by four young and bright men might just help change the world. What do you think? Share your thoughts!,,,0,0,,

A Maryland public school La Plata High is being sued for forcing children to learn about Islam and the Muslim ways. The Marine dad John Kevin Wood and his wife were furious when they found out about the Islam lesson. This isnt the first school we have heard about doing this. Islam is subtly being pushed onto our next generation. From awm: For example one of the assignments wrote that the Islamic creed of Shahada which means There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. The Woods are upset that their daughter was force fed this knowledge about the religion that is foreign to them. According to the Washington Free Beacon when non-Muslims recite this phrase out loud they are essentially converting to Islam. But the La Plata High School forced their students to do more than just recite the Islamic creed. They forced to students to memorize the Five Pillars of Islam. If they teach Islam be sure to include how females are second rate citizens. How in some Muslim countries they cannot drive show their face in public or they will shame their family. That sharia law exists! Shall I go ON!! Educate yourselves you will teach our children about the crusades but say nothing about whats happening right in your face!

ABC downplayed the bombshell admission by presenting Nelsons forgery as merely notes added to the inscription Moore allegedly wrote in her yearbook. In addition ABC reporter Tom Llamas coached Nelson in the interview and put words in her mouth in an obvious effort to downplay the enormous significance of her deceit. Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription. But the message was all Roy Moore Llamas leads. Beverly he signed your yearbook states Llamas. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson replies. After Nelson admitted forgery of the document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News just moved on. Without asking her why she lied or why it took so long for her to come forward with the truth Llamas let the matter slide. Nelson has made emotional public claims that Moore attempted to sexually assault her when she was just 16-years-old. Nelson and her attorney Gloria Allred are planning a news conference Friday but the forgery admission is already out there. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama said Breitbart News. The publication pointed out that Nelson has a motive: As a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis for weeks and now its clear why that request was rejected and ignored. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore: Leigh Corfman claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfmans living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores other accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. Thanks to New Medias going behind the discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know Johnson did not tell the entire truth according to Breitbart. She was not in Moores office on business. If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an unfit absent and unstable mother.

Jesus Ramon Sanchez from the Little Havana neighborhood in Miami was allegedly attempting to engage in sexual intercourse with a 4-year old male pit bull when the dog defended itself by tearing off the mans genitals with its teeth. The incident took place around 8:30 this morning in the Allen Morris Dog Park in Miami. According to witnesses 4-year old Spanky was playing with his owner in the park when Mister Sanchez grabbed him and attempted to rape him. The male pit bull violently resisted and severely injured its attackers legs arms and groin. The dog was just running around playing with a ball when the man came out of nowhere and tried to grab it says Dorothy Steinberg a witness of the events. The man had his pants down and was struggling with the dog. Everyone in the park was just stunned and nobody did anything but the dog defended itself and bit back. In a matter of seconds he grabbed the mans genitals with its teeth and literally tore them apart. And this is not the 1st case below its video from last October .,,,0,0,,

Maybe this was her attempt at humor but shes not funny and is an outspoken member of the Resistance. Its almost certain she was serious and a 100% certain that this is a major federal crime for which she could spend 15 years in the slammer. As you may have heard liberals are vehemently against the GOP tax reform bill because it kills them that people get to keep more of the money they earn. This is a shitty thing but liberals are shitty people so their opposition to across-the-board tax cuts is consistent. Also consistently shitty is Rosie ODonnells attacks on all things Trump related. Because the President is behind this tax bill Rosie busted out the big guns: so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 i will HAPPILY pay any GOP senator 2 million dollars to vote NO they have been paid obviously ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 cold hard cash to any god senator who votes no ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Rosies plan didnt work and the Tax Cut and Jobs Act passed where it is now headed to the Presidents desk to be signed into law. As you can tell by ODonnells tweets she offered 2 million each to Republican Senators Susan Collins and Jeff Flake (not actually a Republican) if they voted against the GOP tax bill. She then made the same offer to any Republican Senator. I know Rosie is pretty stupid but even she has to have known that was an attempted bribery. 18 U.S. Code 201 Bribery of public officials and witnesses is pretty clear in defining this crime. Any attempt to influence a public officials public act with an offer of something of value is bribery and a felony. ODonnell offered 4 million dollars which is something of value to get two Senators who are public officials to vote against a tax bill which is a public act. Shes guilty as hell of this. It doesnt matter if ODonnell doesnt really have 4 million dollars she hasnt worked in years she made the offer. She would probably try to argue that she was making a joke but itd be too easy to prove in a court of law that she aint funny. It would also be easy to prove that she has been working against the Trump administration and Republicans for over a year just be entering her hysterical Twitter feed into evidence. This was a serious offer as delusional as it may be. The punishment for attempting to bribe a public official is up to 15 years in prison and a fine of three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value. Since she offered 2 million to each senator thats 6 million a piece or 12 million total. But it gets more interesting since she also offered any Republican senator the same deal. There are 52 Republican Senators and at 2 million each that makes 104 million times 3 which is 312 million. In addition shed be looking at 52 cases of trying to bribe a public official so she could also face 780 years in prison. I doubt Trump or AG Jeff Sessions will actually pursue a criminal case against ODonnell but it would be hilarious if they did. Finally something associated with her would be funny. It also might get these crybaby liberals to watch what the hell the say while throwing their temper tantrums. Follow Brian Anderson on Twitter,,,0,0,,

(See evidence below.) (Follow all the news on Antifa at Antifa.news.) In August of this year we proclaimed that Antifa should be declared a domestic terrorism organization. Yahoo News a radical left-wing news cult staffed by delusional obedient left-wing propagandists went on to endorse the Antifa terrorist organization with a glowing review joining fake news leader CNN which also endorsed Antifa as part of its effort to destroy America and overthrow the results of a democratic election that put Trump into office. Not long after undercover footage caught Antifa terrorism operatives planning to trap conservatives in kill zones where they could be dispatched with deadly weapons. In just the last two years at least ten journalists have been violently assaulted by Antifa whackos and left-leaning Whole Foods now owned by Dr. Evil globalist Jeff Bezos began promoting and profiting from the sales of terror-inspired Antifa gear. (Yes Whole Foods is now part of the deranged radical Left just like the Washington Post and CNN) Many of Americas leftist universities are now well documented to function as terrorist recruitment hubs for Antifa terrorist groups and in September of 2017 the FBI and DHS finally officially classified Antifa as being engaged in domestic terrorist violence. One Antifa leader / recruiter has been identified as a college professor named Mike Isaacson who openly endorses dead cops. Note that Antifa leaders and members routinely and openly call for extreme acts of violence against police the government and Trump supporters often justifying their death demands by claiming violence is necessary to convert America to a left-wing communist nation by murdering those who oppose their radical political views. Any who oppose Antifa are labeled Nazis which is then used to justify their murder. Antifas history of railway sabotage now comes to light with these shocking facts Now in the aftermath of the deadly Amtrak derailment in Dupont Washington we have learned shocking facts that point to Antifas role in the deadly terrorism act that has spilled blood in Washington: Antifa sabotaged a train in Olympia Washington claiming the train was transporting fracking supplies. In true left-wing Antifa style 20 30 protesters reportedly camped out on the railroad tracks to disrupt rail transport. They then hailed the disruption as a victory for left-wing justice. This was all covered in The Olympian a local paper. The Washington Post a radical left-wing anti-America publisher also owned by globalist Jeff Bezos who owns the Whole Foods that profited from selling terrorist Antifa gear published a glowing review of Antifas domestic terrorism activities all but encouraging them to carry out more such acts. The Antifa-echoing website Puget Sound Anarchists bragged about sabotaging trains in Washington claiming During this week we attached wire and jumper cables to the main Union Pacific rail line running through the state of Nebraska to disrupt rail signals and delay trains that mainly carry coal from the mountainous west to population centers in the east. Inspiration for us came from the blockade in Olympia Unistoten camp in unceded Wetsuweten territory and other actions large and small across turtle island. until the complete destruction of time itself love and rage from the middle of nowhere bragged about sabotaging trains in Washington claiming During this week we attached wire and jumper cables to the main Union Pacific rail line running through the state of Nebraska to disrupt rail signals and delay trains that mainly carry coal from the mountainous west to population centers in the east.

They have since removed the post but it was originally found at this link. In typical left-wing rant fashion this website explained This action was done to disrupt the movement of trains carrying proppants used in natural gas fracturing.

The NY Post is now reporting that the deadly Amtrak derailment may have been caused by the train striking something on the railway as published at this NYpost.com link. Earlier this year a prominent #Antifa website published an article tacking credit for the sabotage of train tracks in Olympia WA. In this article they claimed to have poured concrete on the tracks. It has since been deleted. #Amtrak pic.twitter.com/aHfwdSM1ce Far Left Watch (@FarLeftWatch) December 18 2017 The left-wing terror WAR on America has begun Through countless podcasts videos and articles Ive repeatedly warned that the radicalization of the Left in America would lead to deadly acts of sabotage and terrorism. Now it seems that war has begun in Washington where the derailment of this train in light of all the threats and sabotage that has been carried out by Antifa groups is no mere coincidence. Antifa has shifted to active domestic terrorism against Americas civilians. The insanity of left-wing universities and anti-Trump hysteria has reached a new level of extreme danger for innocent Americans. This derangement whipped up by the late-night lunatic Jimmy Kimmel and other TV hate speech entertainers is now placing all Americans in the path of the Lefts insatiable appetite for slaughter. Today its a commuter train tomorrow it may be a jumbo jet an airport or a sports stadium. There is no limit to what Antifa can justify carrying out as theyve already labeled any who oppose them fascists and therefore excused their murder. In this way the extreme Left in America has become a dangerous cult of deranged delusional maniacs who see themselves as revolutionaries who seek the rise of communism to overthrow this nations existing government. Just yesterday in fact BuzzFeeds U.K. science editor a completely deranged lunatic named Kelly Oakes tweeted All I want for Christmas is full Communism now. As TheWrap.com reported: A spokesperson for BuzzFeed declined to comment on the matter. Oakes who does not report to the websites U.S.-based science desk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Critics pointed out that Communism as practiced by the Soviet Union China and North Korea has led to the deaths of over 100 million people according to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. Keep in mind that this deranged lunatic is BuzzFeeds science editor! Yes to the Left being a mentally deranged lunatic does not necessarily disqualify anyone from commenting on climate change abortion or the genetics of biological gender. (Thats because the Left has completely abandoned all real science in favor of mob-mentality surges of screaming crybullies who make irrational demands while declaring they alone have a monopoly on consensus because of their sheer numbers.) Media outlets that encouraged and promoted Antifa The radicalized Left in America has become at best a hate group. At worst its now a terrorist organization. And it has long enjoyed the support of left-wing media organizations and internet giants including: Yahoo! News CNN Washington Post New York Times The Huffington Post MSNBC Google YouTube Facebook Twitter BuzzFeed These journo-terrorism organizations (and many more) continue to promote and encourage the maniacal violence of the deranged Left. From the recent irrational insanity over Net Neutrality to the outright hoax of Russia collusion with the Trump campaign the deranged Left has devolved into an organized hate group that has now spurred its most extreme members Antifa to carry out deadly acts of terrorism on U.S. soil. Should it be proven that the Amtrak derailment was a deliberate act of sabotage all these left-wing media outlets will have been complicit in these tragic deaths. They contributed to the hatred and even published glowing articles about Antifa terrorists while refusing to denounce their tactics of violence and destruction. Thats why Ive called the left-wing media journo-terrorism. Arrest all Antifa members nationwide: Round them up lock them up and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law If it is established that Antifa deliberately sabotaged that Amtrak train this realization should unleash a nationwide manhunt for all Antifa members and recruiters including the ones on college campuses across the country. Its time to arrest these domestic extremists and for once tell them that society will no longer tolerate their crybully tactics. All members of Antifa should be rounded up locked up and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law (which should now include the charge of murder for those directly involved in Washington). If the police need assistance in this process I have no doubt that millions of Americans would support activating the National Guard for this purpose. Some college campuses are truly terror recruiting hubs that need to be rooted out cleaned out and restored to institutions of higher education. We the People can no longer allow these deranged dangerous Leftists to go unchallenged as they attempt to carry out acts of mayhem and murder across this nation (in the name of justice of course). They must be identified arrested and imprisoned. These left-wing lunatics run the gamut from murderers to terrorists and they openly despise democracy liberty the U.S. Constitution and any person exhibiting political opposition to their left-wing fascist goals. In truth these anti-fascists are themselves todays most poignant echo of the Third Reich and its reign of terror over innocents. In their deranged quest to bring justice to America Antifa members have become the very thing they claim to despise: Genocidal fascists who are a threat to everyone else in a civilized society. Theres one thing American soldiers learned in World War II that should be remembered today: The way to deal with genocidal fascists is to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem make a plan of attack and go take them out until youve utterly destroyed their ability to continue operations. This needs to be done now in America or we may lose this country to actual communists who are meticulously working to overthrow this nation from within. Stay informed as this story unfolds. Here are some of the most important websites to keep reading. Avoid all mainstream media sites as they are now almost universally working with the terrorists and are deliberately publishing fake news every day: Antifa.news Covers Antifa actions and crimes. FarLeftWatch.com Documents the crimes and mass mental illness of the far left.

The New York Post reported that a government official briefed on the deadly Amtrack crash in Washington state says that the derailment may have been caused by an object intentionally placed on the track: A preliminary investigation suggests maintenance problems are unlikely to blame because the incident took place on brand-new tracks the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. As of this writing at least six people were killed but health officials expect the death toll to rise after several of the Amtrak 501 cars left the track with some spilling over a bridge railing onto busy U.S. Interstate 5 below. PJ Medias Debra Heine reported that ISIS shouldnt be the only terrorist group under suspicion for the derailment. She went on to point out that last April the anarchist group Its Going Down bragged online about sabotaging railroad tracks in the Pacific Northwest in order to block fracking equipment from reaching its destination (because you know having cheap energy and a booming economy isnt something that anarchists really support). Since Mondays derailment however the group deleted the post Heine noted further perhaps as a means of hiding its responsibility. Its Going Downs initial claim of sabotaging railroad tracks was supported by a Twitter account called Official Antifa which tweeted June 28: Here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on train tracks. We also include a how-to video at bottom of article. Here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on train tracks. We also include a how-to video at bottom of article:https://t.co/jToAfuL1vH pic.twitter.com/gUJdE2b9xL Official Antifa (@OfficialAntifa) June 28 2017 On April 20 under the headline Puget Sound Anarchists Its Going Down published this: Early in the morning of April 20th we poured concrete on the train tracks that lead out of the Port of Olympia to block any trains from using the tracks. We took precautions to notify BNSF (the train company) we called them and we used wires to send a signal that the tracks were blocked. We did this not to avoid damaging a train nothing would bring bigger grins to our faces but to avoid the risk of injuring railway workers. This action was done to disrupt the movement of trains carrying proppants used in natural gas fracturing. These train tracks are part of a system of pipelines fracking wells mines clearcuts control centers fiberoptics dams highways and factories that cover the planet and are physical manifestations of a process that is destroying the ecosystems cultures and inhabitants everywhere. The same Puget Sound group claimed solidarity with rail sabotage near Medford Oregon in November The Gateway Pundit reported. Naturally the post was submitted anonymously because well anarchists are cowards. Its a safe bet that U.S. intelligence agencies and the Department of Homeland Security along with the portion of the FBI that hasnt been politically corrupted by Barack Obama are aware of this group and its threats. Its also a safe bet that U.S. authorities are investigating the possible terrorism angle to Mondays derailment. (Related: FINALLY: FBI launching terrorism probe into Antifa criminals.) But whats not clear is just how far these idiots are prepared to go in order to push their warped dangerous agenda. Because if Antifa or Antifa-aligned groups are responsible for Mondays derailment they just crossed a big fat red line that makes them fair game for the rest of us who love our country and who want nothing more than to help the Trump administration bring them to justice. We cant have Alt-Left terrorist idiots sabotaging trains or destroying other infrastructure sectors. So if thats what happened all of us who love our country have an obligation to help find them and bring them to justice. J.D.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) if they voted against the GOP plan. ODonnell tweeted again If they vote no no I will not kill Americans for the [super] rich she added No shit. 2 million. Cash. Each. ODonnell then attempted to tweet directly at Collins although she used an incorrect Twitter handle telling the senator to call her if she wanted to negotiate the $2 million offer. Collins and Flake both voted for the bill which has been criticized as a boon for the wealthy and corporations pushing it through the Senate early Wednesday morning. The House also voted to pass the bill but will have to vote again on Wednesday because of two provisions that the Senate said did not comply with budget rules. It is illegal to offer money to public officials with the intent to influence official acts like voting on a bill but it is unclear if ODonnells tweet was meant as a serious offer. so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com,,,0,0,,

Four of the people who were camping on the tracks refused to leave and were subsequently arrested. - Cassandra Fairbanks Questions need to be asked. If there is solidarity between anarchists who will kill Americans for their communist paradise and Antifa who assault people in the street for wrongthink- what is the difference? Is there a difference between anarchists who will kill you because they hate society and Antifa who will try to kill you for wearing a MAGA hat? If Antifa is now copying anarchist tactics and derailing trains then it is time for President Trump to declare Antifa a domestic terrorist group. It cannot be allowed to pass that people claim to be on the right side of history as they kill innocent people. Antifa is known to merely be the revival of the communist street gang Antifaschistiche Aktion. They must be in order for their Nazi-Hunt to mean anything at all. Now the United States Government must recognize that this is no pink p*ssy hat wearing march to hear Madonna fantasize about blowing up the White House. Mr. President if this turns out to be true citizens are dying at the hands of Communist terrorist groups on United States soil. These terrorists are backed by thousands of liberals who have been hoodwinked into believing that there is a legitimate Nazi takeover of America led by the President himself. Now it may be that at least 6 people have died at the hands of communists. When Heather Heyer died in Charlottesville her death became a clarion call for all to see that the cause of the so-called anti-fascists was just.

While no Democrats voted in support of the bill you can bet that was based on politics alone and there were a handful who would have gladly supported this bill (Joe Manchin (D-WV) and his gang of moderate Democrats) if the optics wouldnt have been so ugly for the Democrat Party. However thats not what people are focusing on Instead savvy Internet denizens noticed that Rosie may have just broken federal law in her efforts to impact the tax reform vote. Conservative journalists David Harsanyi and Jeff Jacoby pointed ODonnell to the law she broke: According to 18 USCS prec 201(b) whoever directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official with intent to influence that persons official act will be fined for the offence of bribery.

Prioritize. Allahpundit (@allahpundit) December 20 2017 If Trump orders Sessions to investigate Rosie he will be carved into Rushmore by Friday. Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) December 20 2017 Yes attempting to bribe our legislators is a federal crime punishable by both major fine and prison time. Im not certain that any prosecutor would be able to prove that ODonnell was seriously attempting to bribe a public official but I am certain that if one of them would have reached out to Rosie and agreed to her terms she would have paid to kill the tax reform bill. Rosie spent the Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning ranting about how the GOP was robbing America stealing from the poor and taking from average citizens. How is this possible? How could a TAX CUT possibly be robbery? Its literally the OPPOSITE. A tax cut means that the average American will now keep more of their hard-earned money not less. The GOP isnt taking more money they are allowing Americans to keep more money. Its the opposite of robbery its philanthropy. The Republican Party just stepped in and told the federal government (and the Democrat Party) that enough was enough there would be no more robbing of the American middle class. Of course no one is accusing Rosie ODonnell of being particularly sane or intelligent. In fact after reading Ben Shapiros brilliant tweet from above Rosie responded to him in the ugliest way possible. https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/943476969710260229 It was at this point that Shapiro proved to be Rosies better by winning the internet with his response.

It is actually the first thing they do when they sit in them. But heres something that you didnt know. Turning on the A/C right after you enter your car can be very dangerous and even fatal for your health. Everytime you leave your car outside you close the windows and during this period the car accumulates benzene. When you park your car in the shade it accumulates 400-800 mg of benzene. But did you know that the level of benzene increases to 2000-4000 mg when you leave you car under direct sunlight? This is a shocking fact considering that 2000-4000 mg of increased benzene is 40 times higher than the safe level. To be more precise when you sit in the car with closed windows you inhale the dangerous benzene. Inhaling excessive amounts of benzene is toxic and affects the function of your lungs liver bone tissue and kidneys. Then the organism needs time to eliminate the inhaled benzene. In the cars owners manual you will read that the windows of the car should be opened before you turn on the A/C but it is not specified why. How would doctors explain this? The air conditioner in your car removes all the heated air out before it starts to cool the air in it. It also removes the benzene which is carcinogenic. So make sure you open the windows of your car for several minutes and then you can turn on the air conditioner. This piece of advice will help you protect your health and the health of others.

Beverly Nelson has admitted that she forged a portion of the high school yearbook that she and attorney Gloria Allred used as proof of her accusations against Roy Moore. The now infamous Yearbook Signing that Allred trotted out along with the accuser who gave the worst acting to come out of California in decades already had multiple problems that proved it to be fake. Nelson is one of the women who accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of making advances on her when she was a teen and he was a local prosecutor. She admitted Friday to writing part of the yearbook inscription shed offered as proof a new crack in her story that gives Moore an opening to attack her credibility. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 Nelson went public three weeks ago with the accusation that Moore groped and attempted to force a sexual act on her in 1977. Prior to the alleged assault she claimed he was a regular customer at the restaurant where she worked in Etowah County Alabama and often flirted with her. Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription ABC News tells us. But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbook ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence. Llamas also fails to ask any follow-ups such as If the explanation is this simple why wait all these weeks to offer it? Or Why did you lie? At the initial November 13 press conference where she first made the allegation she held up her yearbook which included a message that appeared to be written and signed by Moore with the date and the name of the restaurant below as corroboration of her acquaintance with the then-assistant district attorney. She did not mention anything about adding notes then. He wrote in my yearbook as follows: To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas Christmas 1977 Love Roy Moore Olde Hickory House. Roy Moore DA she said. Judge Roy Moore was not a DA he was an assistant DA and would have not signed it as the District Attorney. At the time Nelson did not admit to writing the date and name of the restaurant herself. The implication was that it had been written by Moore. Moore tweeted Friday Now she herself admits to lying. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama. Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. Moore has denied signing the yearbook and said he did not know Nelson at the time. Moore who went on to become a judge and then the Chief Justice of the Alabama State Supreme Court later ruled against Nelson in a 1999 divorce case. This issue of the signature being forged jumped out from the very beginning as there were some serious discrepancies. (40) ADDENDUM: Unless Moores handwriting has changed the yearbook signature is a forgery. Look at the ""R"" and ""y"" in ""Roy."" Also ""12-22-77"" and ""Olde Hickory House"" were written by a different person. Look at the two versions of the number ""7."" pic.twitter.com/dn4z1dMiUe Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 14 2017 The sevens in 1977 to the right of Christmas are very different from the sevens in the date (12-22-77) above Old Hickory House. Look at the two versions of the number 7 tweeted Wictor. 12-22-77 and Olde Hickory House were written by a different person he added. Next Wictor points out the R and y in Roy are not written the same way. The inflection of the Y is more pronounced in Moore signature as Chief Justice. The R is noticeably longer in the signature of Chief Justice as well. During his legal career Judge Moore became the first full-time Deputy District Attorney in Etowah County Alabama and served in this position from 1977 until 1982. In 1984 Judge Moore undertook private practice of law in Gadsden Alabama states Moores bio on his campaign website. Did Gloria Allred do it personally? No. But there is no doubt that she knew when she faced those cameras that the yearbook signing was a forgery. There should be consequences.",,,0,0,,

On 11 March 2016 World News Daily Report published an article reporting that Naples Zoo keeper was killed while attempting to sexually assault a 12-foot long reptile: The young man was caught by the throat by the alligator who dragged him underwater and drowned him. Jimmy Olsens death took place around 6:00 AM this morning but his disappearance was noticed only an hour later by other employees. They finally discovered his dismembered body floating in the pool of the alligator enclosure around 8:30. The images captured by the security cameras show that Mr Olsen had clearly placed himself in a very vulnerable position Captain White told reporters. He had his pants around his knees and was lying down on top of one the animals with his back to the others. The poor guy didnt stand a chance! We can see him being dragged in the water then he disappears from sight. He was probably dead within thirty seconds of the attack. Although Mr. Olsens is the first zoo worker to die while having sexual intercourse with an animal he is not the first one to be implicated in an incident implicating bestiality. In 2002 three employees of the Columbus zoo were condemned after it was revealed that the zookeepers allowed people into the zoo after business hours for the purpose of copulating with the animals.,,,0,0,,

The measure will deliver a tax cut to 80% of Americans but Democratic lawmakers are in full denial mode claiming the measure is a ploy to rob the poor while lining the pockets of the rich. Obviously they would prefer the status quo where the government directs taxpayer funds toward such nationally beneficial ends as buying the silence of rape accusers. The passage has triggered liberal celebrities as well none more than Trump-hater Rosie ODonnell who is so convinced that the law will f*ck the nation (her words) that she is willing to do jail time for her beliefs.

The fact that people like Rosie ODonnell think that the movie and television industry wouldnt survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are. Mike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry.

The people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets who make the costumes who create the props and in some cases do the stunts and the special effectsMike explained. And theyre not getting the bazillion dollar deals. Its about time that these jerkoffs realize that they arent the only people in this world. The fact remains that Donald Trump is our President whether they like it or not and that isnt about to change. Lets hope that for the sake of everyone else in Hollywood these ignorant celebrities suck it up and deal with the fact that their candidate didnt win.

According to the study 75 percent of flavored e-cigarettes and their refill liquids were found to contain Diacetyl a flavoring chemical linked to cases of severe respiratory disease such as the incurable condition called Popcorn Lung. According to Harvard the condition otherwise known as bronchiolitis obliterans was colloquially termed Popcorn Lung because it first appeared in workers who inhaled artificial butter flavor in microwave popcorn processing facilities. But despite the name of the disease there is absolutely nothing savory about it. Popcorn Lung is a debilitating and irreversible respiratory disease which causes scarring in tiny air sacs in the lungs that lead to excessive coughing and shortness of breath similar to that seen in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In analyzing 51 different flavored e-cigarettes author of the study Joseph Allen and his team found at least one of three top toxins diacetyl acetoin and 23-pentanedione in 47 of the e-cigs. Not only that the amount of diacetyl in 39 of the e-cigs exceeded the amount that was able to be detected by the laboratory. Diacetyl and other related flavoring chemicals are used in many other flavors beyond butter-flavored popcorn including fruit flavors alcohol flavors and candy flavored e-cigarettes said Allen assistant professor of exposure assessment science at Harvard. He found this particularly disturbing because of the appeal fruity e-cigarettes such as Cotton Candy Fruit Squirts and Cupcake may have to young people. Since e-cigarettes are a fairly new technology the studys co-author David Christiani Elkan Blout Professor of Environmental Genetics warns that Popcorn Lung may be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the dangers e-cigs pose to their users: Since most of the health concerns about e-cigarettes have focused on nicotine there is still much we do not know about e-cigarettes. In addition to containing varying levels of the addictive substance nicotine they also contain other cancer-causing chemicals such as formaldehyde and as our study shows flavoring chemicals that can cause lung damage. Based on that it might be best to try and kick the habit ASAP. See how e-cigarettes almost cost this man his life:,,,0,0,,

It is famous for sucking in (mysteriously) anything and everything that comes in its area. Right from flights to ships everything has lost its way in here. But what happened recently might just be the curse breaker for this scary place. 2. The Reappeared Ship Apparently something happened that this Triangle is not really known for. A ship that was lost recently reappeared magically behind the winds within the waves. Well this is no joke my friends. On a very serious note a ship just reappeared mysteriously out of nowhere. 3. Was First Spotted On The Cuban Coast Guard announced that they had intercepted an unmanned ship heading for the island which is presumed to be the SS Cotopaxi a tramp steamer which vanished in December 1925 and has since been connected to the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. See told yll I was serious! This ship was first spotted on May 16 near a restricted military zone west of Havana by the Cuban authorities! They made many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the crew and finally mobilized three patrol boats to intercept it. 4. When It First Vanished On 29 November 1925 the SS Cotopaxi departed Charleston South Carolina and headed towards Havana Cuba. The ship had a crew of 32 men under the command of Captain W. J. Meyer and was carrying a cargo of 2340 tons of coal. It was reported missing two days later and was unheard of for almost 90 years. When the ship was first lost no one mustve imagined that itll reappear 90 years later in such condition. But to everyones surprise it did 5. The Investigation The Vice President of Council of Ministers General Abelardo Colome announced that the Cuban authorities were going to conduct a thorough investigation to elucidate the mystery of the ships disappearance and reappearance. After this incident the scientists are already excited about the new pattern of research theyll conduct in the area. Lets wait an watch if some more missing things resurface back in this area!

A Georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional Muslim veils. State Rep. Jason Spencer (R) filed legislation on Wednesday that would prevent women from posing for drivers license photos while wearing a veil. The measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving. Spencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about Islamic terrorism. Spencers bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk. This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us Spencer told WSB-TV in Atlanta.

Bhalla and Zimmer shook hands then Bhalla shocked the roughly 200 citizens in attendance with his decree that the word Christmas shall not be said at government functions. Zimmer looked as shocked as everyone else but she reluctantly agreed that she would keep her word and that no public officials in Hoboken were permitted to use that word in an official capacity. According to the Hoboken Journal the event was closed to the public and journalists were not permitted to bring cameras and our incoming mayor is probably glad of that. The crowd began to boo loudly and one man was escorted out after throwing a souffle at Bhallas head knocking his turban off the Journal reports. Eventually things returned to normal but there was a sense of displeasure the rest of the evening. This war on Christmas has gone on long enough.

She did it over and over again: so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Rosie may have hit the hooch last night if her other tweets are any indicator: rachel meadow asks ""was susan collins engaged did u feel a heartbeat was she human"" SHE THINKS ITS SEXIST ? NO U SEE SUSAN STOOD AND SAID NO I WONT KILL AMERICANS AND NOW SHE SAYS ""YES YES I WILL KILL AMERICANS"" FUCK U SUSAN COLLINS U MAKE ME SICK UR NO WOMAN ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 WE CANNOT SIT AT HOME WHILE THEY ROB OUR NATION YOUR NEIGHBORS HEALTH CARE FOR THE FUCKING MERCERS AND KOCH BROTHERS FUCK THEM RISE UP ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Rachel Meadow would certainly not be pleased. Bribery is illegal under federal law. Heres the relevant portion of 18 USC 201(b): Whoever (1)directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity with intent (A) to influence any official act; or (B) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing or collude in or allow any fraud or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud on the United States; or (C) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person; shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value whichever is greater or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years or both and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor trust or profit under the United States. So Rosie actually broke the law with the tweet itself. Attorney General Sessions get cracking!",,,0,0,,

Rosie ODonnell seems to have snapped again. Thats what happens when youre more worn than an old rubber band. She doesnt seem to bounce back anymore (see Rosie ODonnell Blasts Kevin Spacey. Accidentally Admits She Knew of His Pervy Ways and Poor Rosie ODonnell Thinks She Wont Survive Trump). Rosie wants to bribe senators with millions to vote against Trumps tax plan. Hell to legalities. so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Straight up bribery.

I didnt know she was an elementary school dropout. Another unfortunate victim of the public school system. I base this on the immaturity of her writing. Many worry she is also the victim of poor mental health: Some of Rosies followers actually asking if these bribes could work? Really people are u that gullible? Scary.

And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News the disgraced left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding notes to the inscription. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription ABC News tells us But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbookABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence. Nelson is accusing Moore of attempting to assault her when she was just 16-years-old. With the election just four days away this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for Moore. Nelson and Allred are planning a news conference later Friday but nothing will overcome the forgery admission. How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama. Another problem with Nelson is that she has motive to lie and forge as a circuit judge Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case. The Moore campaign have been pressuring Nelson and Allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. Now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore. One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14 year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfman living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (The Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. Thanks to New Media going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moores office on business. If she was in Moores office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnsons mother who was trying to gain custody of Johnsons 12 year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was a unfit absent and unstable mother. 1 2,,,0,0,,

The Tax Cut and Reform Bill was passed just a few hours ago but while it was still in the balance late last night Rosie took to Twitter to start offering $2 million to any GOP Senator who would take the bribe to vote against the bill. so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 In particular she called out Senators Susan Collins and Jeff Flake offering millions in cash for their change of heart. If youre not a Twitter user you should know that DM stands for Direct Message. susan 2 million dollars cash call if u want to negotiate do u think your family is proud of u @sennatorcollins woman mother grandmother sister daughter u have betrayed us all dear god ask for forgiveness redeem ur soul tomorrow #NOTSEXIST pic.twitter.com/wa0QcMXNk2 ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 And on and one she went. She also attacked the Mercer and Koch family units who are conservatives who use their financial resources to fund conservative causes. Legally. Here Rosie decides that families who legally use their money to support their political beliefs is robbery but apparently handing out cash bribe is just dandy. Heres one tweet: WE CANNOT SIT AT HOME WHILE THEY ROB OUR NATION YOUR NEIGHBORS HEALTH CARE FOR THE F**KING MERCERS AND KOCH BROTHERS F**K THEM RISE UP Other Twitter users pointed out that offering bribes is illegal (not to mention stupid to offer bribes on social media where everyone can read it) Rosie disagreed that what she was doing was wrong. Argue it in court lady. She said that removing the Obamacare mandate forcing individuals to own health insurance will kill Americans and her cash bribes are just a way to save the lives of Americans. It would be criminal to not take the money! She also found fault with Twitter users who suggested that she could do the same as those Mercers and the Koch brothers and legally fund efforts to push her beliefs. Rosie ODonnell has been feuding with Donald Trump for years even before he announced his run. In 2006 ODonnell then a host of The View said that she doesnt enjoy Trump and claimed that he had once gone bankrupt and that he is not a self-made man. Rosie then accused Trump of cheating on his first wife and Trump responded by calling Rosie a real loser and that she is a woman out of control. If you asked Trump hed say what he said in 2014. She started it! And Donald might be around as the police finish it if she is charged with a felony. Trump has been insulting Rosie via Twitter since at least 2011: I feel sorry for Rosie s new partner in love whose parents are devastated at the thought of their daughter being with @Rosiea true loser. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 14 2011 .@Cher attacked @MittRomney. She is an average talent who is out of touch with reality. Like @Rosie ODonnell a total loser! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10 2012 Rosie is crude rude obnoxious and dumb other than that I like her very much! Donald J.

The former FBI director writes about his handling of the Hillary Clinton probe in his new book A Higher Loyalty the memoir about to be released to the public next week. As Comey muses on the influences of pride and hubris in his memoir the New York Times puts two of Comeys most controversial 2016 moves in that context as does Comey himself: Long passages in Comeys thesis are also devoted to explicating the various sorts of pride that Niebuhr argued could afflict human beings most notably moral pride and spiritual pride which can lead to the sin of self-righteousness. And in A Higher Loyalty Comey provides an inventory of his own flaws writing that he can be stubborn prideful overconfident and driven by ego. Those characteristics can sometimes be seen in Comeys account of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation wherein he seems to have felt a moral imperative to address in a July 2016 press conference what he described as her extremely careless handling of very sensitive highly classified information even though he went on to conclude that the bureau recommend no charges be filed against her. His announcement marked a departure from precedent in that it was done without coordination with Department of Justice leadership and offered more detail about the bureaus evaluation of the case than usual. As for his controversial disclosure on Oct. 28 2016 11 days before the election that the F.B.I. was reviewing more Clinton emails that might be pertinent to its earlier investigation Comey notes here that he had assumed from media polling that Clinton was going to win. He has repeatedly asked himself he writes whether he was influenced by that assumption: It is entirely possible that because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls. But I dont know. How does one even begin to unpack this? Comey seems to want credit for struggling with his soul on the basis that (a) law-enforcement leadership is a tough job and (b) he tried to separate his own ego from his decision-making. It comes across more like whining though especially when the conundrum was of his own making. Having conducted the July 2016 press conference that all but closed the Hillary Clinton probe apparently while aware of serious conflicts of interest at the Department of Justice that Comey still hasnt fully disclosed he had little choice but to inform Congress that he had to reopen the probe in late October. You know what would have prevented the whole thing? Keeping his mouth shut about all of the investigations in the first place. Thats what an FBI director is supposed to do only commenting when charges get filed. Or when that might not have worked in this case go to Congress to reveal the classified conflicts of interest that might impede his investigations. Comey didnt do either which leaves one with the impression that he was more interested in the politics of the situation then and more interested in the politics of the situation now too. Color Nate Silver unimpressed: If Comeys decision to release the letter on Oct. 28 was influenced by his interpretation of the polls that really ought to cut against his image as an honorable principled decision-maker. Instead he was just being expedient and trying to save his own hide. Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) April 13 2018 Silver wont be alone in this assessment especially among Hillary Clinton supporters who have been torn between blaming Comey for Hillarys loss and championing him as a leader of La Rsistance. And lets revisit this statement specifically emphasis mine: It is entirely possible that because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls. Oddly Comey doesnt seem to have that concern about Trump at least now. Why is that and why would we credit that motivation in October 2016 seeing what has happened since? Get ready for the White House to beat Comey over the head with this passage. Kellyanne Conway got the ball rolling on Fox & Friends this morning calling Comey a disgruntled ex-employee more interested in self-aggrandizement: .@KellyannePolls: [@Comey] sounds like a disgruntled ex-employee who after the fact wants to clear his conscience of what bothered him at the time. If youre that bothered quit. Leave the job. pic.twitter.com/sGog99STqC Fox News (@FoxNews) April 13 2018 Hes taking one or two or three meetings with the president and retroactively putting his own spin on them to sell books Conway said Friday. He sounds like a disgruntled ex-employee who after the fact wants to clear his conscience of what bothered him at the time. If youre that bothered quit. Leave the job she added. Conway continued hitting Comey for his recent and upcoming media appearances over the release of his book A Higher Loyalty: Truth Lies and Leadership. It seems pretty self-aggrandizing to me she added. Granted it takes some chutzpah for anyone working for Trump to complain that his critics are self-aggrandizing but its not an entirely unfounded complaint. Conway raises a good point too. If Comey was really this troubled about Trump and the White House why didnt Comey resign? Would he have found all of this as objectionable if Trump had never fired him?,,,0,0,,

OAN: An accuser against Roy Moore admits to altering a portion of her yearbook calling into question the validity of her allegations against the Senate candidate. During an interview published Friday Beverly Nelson admitted to forging part of a note in the yearbook which has been used as presumed evidence against Moore during his campaign. The interviewer who is part of a left-leaning outlet downplayed the forgery saying she merely wrote notes underneath the signature. Lets look at Beverly Nelson; everybody knows her yearbook is a forgery said Janet Porter a spokeswomen for the Moore campaign. Nelson has accused Moore of sexual misconduct dating back to the 1970s which he has repeatedly denied. This is a huge admission. Even though this doesnt mean his signature isnt real it makes her claims uncredible. Adding the date and not informing the people about you adding it hands Judge Roy Moore a huge victory. He can now point to this and use it to discredit every other allegation that has been thrown against him. Judge Roy Moores entire campaign has been run on being unfairly attacked by the establishment in our country and he keeps getting more ammunition every day. Judge Roy Moore: Alabama Voters are extremely skeptical of allegations against Judge Roy Moore WOW: Judge Roy Moore fundraising has surged since WaPo hit piece ALABAMA WOMEN: Judge Roy Moore is closest thing to a founding father of our time WATCH: Gloria Allred refuses to say whether Roy Moore yearbook signature was forged BOOM!: Judge Roy Moore was not banned from Mall former manager claims report is false Rep.

On Tuesday however she kicked it up a notch: she just might have committed a felony. In the lead-up to the vote on tax reform ODonnell tweeted that she would promise to give Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) $2 million each if they voted against the bill. ODonnell said that ""NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER [sic] RICH"" and implored both senators to ""DM"" (direct message) her on Twitter. She said she would pay them in cash. so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 She doubled down later targeting Collins specifically. ODonnell asked Collins if she felt that her family was proud of her for the vote and included a picture of the extended Collins family. The tweet seemed particularly sexist on the surface but its okay---ODonnell added a #NOTSEXIST tag to the tweet let everyone know that she was not being especially hard on the ""woman - mother - grandmother - sister - daughter"" due to her gender*. (Collins is neither a mother nor a grandmother.) susan - 2 million dollars cash call if u want to negotiate do u think your family is proud of u @sennatorcollins woman - mother - grandmother - sister - daughter u have betrayed us all dear god ask for forgiveness redeem ur soul tomorrow #NOTSEXIST pic.twitter.com/wa0QcMXNk2 ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Small issue with these tweets: bribing a public official is a pretty serious crime and this specific act is punishable with up to 15 years in prison or a fine of three times the bribe--in this case $12 million. Lets check out 18 U.S. Code 201 (b) shall we? (emphasis added) Bribery of public officials and witnesses (b) Whoever (1) directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity with intent (A) to influence any official act; Thats...basically a description of what ODonnell tweeted on Monday.

Mary Lynne Davies who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines. The revelation came after the yearbook inscription that Moore supposedly wrote in the 1970s turned out to be a forgery. Davies who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. Her attorney says she sticks by her story: My clients main concern is that because of the yearbook thing nobody will believe her story. She fabricated the yearbook because nobody would listen in the first place. Shes a victim and now shell be prosecuted while her abuser goes to the US Senate. Nothing about this is right. Nothing. Nothing about this is wrong jerk. Justice Moore is a fine upstanding man who has shown time and time again that he loves America and our family values. He deserves to be exonerated. The AG says hes also looking into charges against the other Moore accusers as well as the employees of that mall that said he was a pedophile. Moores attorney says there are no hard feelings and that his client will continue to fight for womens rights.,,,0,0,,

The State Attorneys Division of Integrity in Elections is calling the acts of the women a blatant disregard for the duties of civil servants a violation of the public trust and a 2nd-degree felony. Wanda Werkmeister Olivia Pertuiary and Maureen Brown will all face charges of conspiracy to contribute to widespread voter fraud and violation of the public trust both punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a million dollars in fines. Roy Moores campaign on the news that voter fraud was rampant in Birmingham and all of Applevale County is standing by at the door of the clerks office to the 17th District Federal Court of Appeals to file an injunction against a single vote from the Democrat stronghold to be counted. Pundits on both sides are speculating that the outcome will almost certainly be a Roy Moore win. Sean Hannity speaking as a guest on Dana Loeschs new show Guns God and Grits said: Without that inner-city ghetto vote Doug Jones doesnt have a chance. It doesnt make much sense why someone from the citys vote is so much more important to Democrats who swear they arent at all racist. The Alabama Office of Election Certification and Ethics says it will abide by the wishes of the Secretary of State before certifying the vote and sending it to the governor for his signature.,,,0,0,,

These sexual allegations range from celebrities to politicians each one worse than the last and there seems to be no end in sight. This past week liberal talking head Matt Lauer was the most recent pervert outed for his disgusting actions against women who worked at the TODAY show and now Geraldo Rivera is under fire for similar allegations. While the country braces for who else will be named as the pervert of this coming week there is one scandal that is hardly getting the media attention it deserves. For the liberal mainstream media Barack Obama could do no wrong and have done their best to protect their diety. So much so that it appears that they have covered up a massive sex scandal that could tarnish Obamas precious legacy forever. A video has emerged of Obama showing him engaged in some highly inappropriate sexual misconduct but what makes it even worse is that CNN has kept under wraps for almost a decade. In the video it shows Obama flaunting an erection on camera and the left has been doing all they can to make sure no one sees it. Disgusting: New video surfaces of Obama showing off his erection in-font of aids on his plane. Listen to their comments#TrumpTape #Lewd pic.twitter.com/eV91SEzbz4 Silence is Consent (@silenceconsent) October 11 2016 Here is more from P.J. Media: Seems we may have uncovered a few more details about CNNs behavior in possibly covering up this video. Back in 2008 at least a portion of the below video of Obama flaunting himself did appear on CNNs website. However no media coverage made any reference to lewdness. There was just reference to the unremarkable news that Obama was wearing jeans. CNN captioned the clip with only what follows which Michelle Malkin and Allahpundit took note of at the time: It appears that the portion of the video that would have created a firestorm had been circumcised by CNN editors. This link to the video as it appeared on CNNs site at the time was included in Allahpundits post: http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2008/05/08/obama.jeans.cnn That link is no longer active. Neither is this one which purportedly linked to the CNN video that had been uploaded to YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F45rXyuTZjo Now what makes this coverup by the mainstream media even more disgusting than seeing Obamas erection is that these liberals attacked then-candidate President Trump over comments he made over a decade ago that he never acted on. Also these same leftists journalists ignored dozens of other sexual misconduct cases in favor of bashing Trump. Here is more from The Daily Wire: 1. Four new women accuse Bill Clinton of sexual assault. (11/20/2017) The Daily Mail reports: Bill Clinton is facing explosive new charges of sexual assault from four women according to highly placed Democratic Party sources and an official who served in both the Clinton and Obama administrations. The current accusations against the 71-year-old former president whose past is littered with charges of sexual misconduct stem from the period after he left the White House in 2001 say the sources. Attorneys representing the women who are coordinating their efforts have notified Clinton they are preparing to file four separate lawsuits against him. 2. Congresswoman accuses Democrat Bob Filner of sexually assaulting her. (11/21/2017) The Huffington Post reports: Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) on Monday accused a former congressman of assaulting her while they were both serving in the House. In an appearance on MSNBCs Meet the Press Daily DeGette said that former Rep. Bob Filner (D-Calif.) at one point tried to pin her in an elevator and forcibly kiss her. Some years ago I was in an elevator and then-Congressman Bob Filner tried to pin me to the door of the elevator and kiss me. And I pushed him away DeGette said. I mean I was his colleague. He couldnt take action against me. And believe you me I never got in an elevator with him again. 3. Democrat Raul Bocanegra resigns leadership position and wont seek re-election over sexual allegations. (11/20/2017) The Los Angeles Times reports: Assemblyman Raul Bocanegra announced he will not seek re-election Monday citing persistent rumors and speculation regarding sexual harassment claims. I spent my life advocating for the Northeast Valley fighting for a fair share for our communities and residents Bocanegra (D-Pacoima) said in a statement. It is because of my deep commitment to you residents of the 39th Assembly District that I have made the decision to resign from the State Assembly effective September 1 2018 and immediately resign my leadership position. I am also suspending my campaign and will not run for re-election. The statement came as The Times was preparing a story reporting that six women had accused him of sexual harassment. That is just the tip of the iceberg but you get the point. The Democrats are the party of disgusting perverts that hide behind the mainstream to make sure no one knows how nasty they are. If the mainstream media were genuinely concerned with reporting the news they would blow the lid off Barack Obamas sexual misconduct as well as Bill Clinton and allow these repugnant individuals answer for their crimes and get the punishment they truly deserve.

The American systemwe look after our own. We look after our citizen we look after our manufacturing base Bannon told CBS anchor Charlie Rose. And guess what? This countrys going to be greater more united more powerful than its ever been. This is not astrophysics. And by the way thats every nationality every race every religion every sexual preference.Bannon pointed out that as long as youre an American citizen youre part of this populous economic nationalist movement.Bannon said his belief in how much economic nationalism can unite Americans of all races and backgrounds was why he told President Donald Trump that he thought he was going to win the election after the Access Hollywood tape was released. Some of Trumps advisers thought he had no chance and even urged Trump to drop out of the race. The Breitbart News executive chairman though said he told Trump he had a 100% chance to win the election if he just doubled down on the economic nationalist message.Thats why I told him Double down every time [on the economic nationalism message] Bannon recalled. And on that day thats the first time and only time he ever got upset with me. He goes Come on its not 100%. I go Its absolutely 100%. And I told him why. They dont care [about locker-room talk].In the end Bannon was right as Trump shocked the world and the political elites on election night as his economic nationalism message galvanized Americans who had not voted in presidential elections because they just got sick and tired of voting for candidates who only appealed to the 3.8%.Bannon told Rose that the American system of protection of our manufacturing a financial system that lends to manufacturers and the control of our borders has always been built on our citizens.I think what we have to do is focus on the American citizens Bannon said.

The rest of Noltes piece explains the many many inconsistencies with the allegations but this revelation makes it abundantly clear that this yearbook signature was forged. She admitted to messing with it. Thats pretty much all the evidence we need. Here is more from Nolte. With Nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against Moore. One is Leigh Corfman who claims Moore molested her as a 14 year-old child. She is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that Moores abuse resulted in Corfman living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records. Moores final accuser is Tina Johnson a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But again as was the case with Corfman and Nelson the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (The Washington Post AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context. This media narrative is crumbling fast. Geez. Even if shes telling the truth about that still being Moores signature (and I still believe it is) this is bad for her story. Should have disclosed. Shouldnt have hired Gloria Allred. https://t.co/AqgSVCNlCV Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) December 8 2017 Why the hell would Allred not have advised her to a.) admit up front that she wrote the date and location under Moores signature to memorialize it and b.) immediately submit it for handwriting analysis? Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) December 8 2017 Are we really supposed to believe that these allegations just magically appeared out of nowhere from 40 years ago right before the election as a total coincidence? Roy Moore has been around for decades and no one brought this up. All of a sudden right before the election hes a monster? You really have to suspend disbelief to buy this story. Yes if he did those things with a 14-year-old hes a bad guy. But its not even remotely a fact he did that. So many of these allegations against Moore have been exposed as just ridiculous. Remember when everyone was running around saying Moore was banned from a mall as if that was a fact? It wasnt a fact and it now actually looks false. Joel Pollak wrote a great piece about how the allegations against Moore arent adding up. Why does only Breitbart seem to care about the truth here? Why are so many people willing to just believe whatever the mainstream media tells them on this?,,,0,0,,

Its not a fair fight but watching conservative wunderkind Ben Shapiro tear up Rosies political arguments on Twitter is one of the more amusing activities of 2017. While this weeks sniping between the two was thoroughly entertaining at the core of the spat is an actual crime. In an effort to stop the tax reform vote Rosie ODonnell offered to pay Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) two million dollars each if theyd vote no and she made this bribery offer on Twitter. A Federal Crime in Public Rosie in her profane barely-literate style was ranting about the tax reform bill that was up for a vote in the Senate. In an effort to stop the reform from going through Rosie engaged in what she thought was a mic-drop moment tweeting an offer of two million dollars each to two Republican senators if they would only vote no: so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 Theres just one problem with Rosies public offer; its called attempting to bribe a public official and its a violation of federal law 18 U.S. Code Section 201 to be exact. The statute reads: Whoever directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity with intent to influence any official act The crime carries a punishment of up to three times the offered amount as well as up to 15 years in prison. That apparently doesnt faze Rosie she doubled down on her tweet a bit later telling Sen. Collins to call if you want to negotiate the 2 million dollars cash offer. Shapiro Chimes In While the Twitter-verse reeled from Rosies blatant public crime Ben Shapiro jumped on the opportunity. If Trump orders [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions to investigate Rosie he will be carved into Rushmore by Friday Shapiro tweeted much to Twitters delight. Rosie responded with a crude profanity and Shapiro got another freebie. Youre already a felon Rosie Shapiro pointed out following his tweet with the hashtag #MeToo. Dont be a homophobic sexual harasser too he added. The Trump administration has not commented on Rosies public bribery attempt or whether it plans to investigate her as of Wednesday morning.,,,0,0,,

I hate this country Canadian Celine Dion said while complaining about the Trump presidency. Youre wrong Celine Julia Roberts fired back. The America we know and love was destroyed by Obama and his disastrous presidency. If you disagree you can always go back to your own country. In fact perhaps you really should. Celine Dion was one of dozens of liberal celebrities who threatened to leave the United States and return to their homelands if America elected Donald Trump as president. So far a grand total of zero of these liberal celebrities have followed through with their threat to leave.

The best moment was obvious too: his tribute to the widow of Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens: Trump stated: We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens the widow of a U.S. Navy special operator Senior Chief William Ryan Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior and a hero battling against terrorism and securing our nation. I just spoke to General [Jim] Mattis who reconfirmed that and I quote Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies. Ryans legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us there is no greater act of love than to lay down ones life for ones friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends for his country and for our freedom we will never forget him. Democrats initially stood for the widow. But then they sat. Trump didnt. As his widow wept and mouthed to heaven I love you baby Trump led a round of applause that lasted two minutes. And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) apparently sat there and didnt cheer as the incredible moment progressed along with Senator Bernie Sanders and others see this video at approximately three minutes in as the cameras pan the crowd. Look at the right hand side of this screenshot: Heres another screenshot a few moments later: Maybe it was more important for Democrats not to cheer in Trumps presence than to cheer a hero.

God knows and Roy knows and I know what happened. He did sign it. When asked by a reporter if she made notes underneath she answered Yes. This is bad enough its ridiculous that attorney Gloria Allred and Nelson didnt reveal that fact when they originally showed the yearbook. It calls into question whether any of the other writing was tampered with; being honest and forthright would have been the only decent policy here. Whats more Nelson writing the time and location under Moores signature but failing to disclose it pegs the date to Nelsons memory without acknowledging that Moore didnt date the signature in the first place. But conservative media immediately decided to deliberately overplay Nelsons actual statement. Breitbart headlined: Bombshell: Roy Moore Accuser Beverly Nelson Admits She Forged Yearbook.

But its simply untrue to say that Nelson admitted she forged the yearbook. She insists that the note and signature from Moore are authentic. Whats more we know that another woman claims she has a copy of a graduation card with Moores signature. And there is another accuser who says Moore molested her when she was 14 and several other women under 18 who say Moore tried to date them when he was in his early 30s. Theres no reason to lie about the story here. Nelson wrote in the yearbook. She didnt reveal it. That raises reasonable doubts. But she did not admit to forging Moores signature or his note.,,,0,0,,

(See evidence below.) (Follow all the news on Antifa at Antifa.news.) In August of this year we proclaimed that Antifa should be declared a domestic terrorism organization. Yahoo News a radical left-wing news cult staffed by delusional obedient left-wing propagandists went on to endorse the Antifa terrorist organization with a glowing review joining fake news leader CNN which also endorsed Antifa as part of its effort to destroy America and overthrow the results of a democratic election that put Trump into office. Not long after undercover footage caught Antifa terrorism operatives planning to trap conservatives in kill zones where they could be dispatched with deadly weapons. In just the last two years at least ten journalists have been violently assaulted by Antifa whackos and the owner of left-leaning Whole Foods now owned by Dr. Evil globalist Jeff Bezos began promoting and profiting from the sales of terror-inspired Antifa gear.

Latifah Brown called 911 around 9:30 PM last night reporting that she had a baby stuck in her vagina. The operator first assumed that she was giving birth at home and dispatched an ambulance to the site. The paramedics had quite a surprise when they arrived on the site and saw what was actually happening. One of the paramedics Brian Whitmore related the incident in an interview with WBNS-10 TV. The little boy wore a diaper and pyjamas but he had his legs and abdomen stuck in the womans vagina. The paramedics spent more than an hour on the site trying to release the child from his difficult position but were unable to get the toddler out. I dont know how she got the child in there! We were both pulling as strong as we could and he wouldnt come out. Ms. Brown and the child were finally transported to the hospital where doctors were able to separate them after a delicate operation. Loading... The young boy suffers from a dislocated hip but doctors dont think he will suffer any sequelae from the incident. The paramedic Ryan Whitmore says he was shocked when he arrived on the scene and saw the fully dressed toddler caught in the womans vagina. The babysitter was interrogated by police and confessed to deliberately inserting the child in her vaginal cavity. She explained that she was feeling depressed after her doctor told her she could never have children and wanted to know how it felt to give birth. Ms. Brown now faces a total of 11 criminal charges including aggravated child neglect causing bodily harm and could spend up to 65 years in prison. Her lawyer has asked for a psychiatric evaluation claiming that she isnt fit to stand trial. Depending on the results of the evaluation her trial could begin in June Loading...

Tom and Janis Morrison a young couple from the small town of Greensboro in Alabama called 911 around 10:00 pm last night to ask for an ambulance. Samantha Irving the operator who took the call says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation. The woman told me that her husband had fallen and that his head was now stuck in her vaginal cavity. I really thought that it was a group of teenagers making a prank call. Despite Ms. Irvings doubts she sent an ambulance on the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious. Bill Austin one of the paramedics who transported the couple claims they were lying naked on their bed and partially covered in blood. The woman kept screaming out in pain whenever the guy moved but he had half of his face buried in there and he looked like he was going through Hell! Loading... The couple was transported to the nearby Hale County Hospital where doctors were able to separate the couple. Ms. Morrison suffered from severe internal bleeding but is now stable while her husband has suffered only a few scratches and bruises. According to doctors both could also suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome. Dr. Frank Olson who treated the couple upon their arrival at the hospital says that such extreme sexual practices are extremely dangerous and recommends to completely avoid them. Incidents like this one are indeed quite unusual but hundreds of couples are admitted to the hospital every year in the U.S. after getting stuck together during sexual intercourse. According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 3213 couples were hospitalized for such problems across the country in 2015 and 3789 in 2016. According to the same data the Morrisons are the first couple to be hospitalized for a head stuck inside a vaginal cavity since October 2007. Loading... Like this: Like Loading...,,,0,0,,

Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription ABC News tells us. But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbook ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 Last month Nelsons attorney Gloria Allred refused to confirm the authenticity of the yearbook and wouldnt hand it over to handwriting experts unless a US Senate Committee agreed to conduct a hearing first. Meanwhile author and former music journalist Thomas Wictor pointed out what appeares to be different ink used on portions of Nelsons yearbook: Well unretouched CNN photo DEFINITELY shows that ""Moore D.A. 12-22-77 Olde Hickory House"" was written in different-colored ink than the rest of the inscription. It appears that this jalopy of an accusation has completely fallen apart. pic.twitter.com/IiA0QP0l2R Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 14 2017 Meanwhile Nelsons stepson Darrel Nelson claims that his stepmothers accusations are one hundred percent a lie stating I know for a fact that there is a lot that that woman does not tell the truth on Nelson claimed in an in-person interview with Breitbart News. Do I think that Beverly is trustworthy? No I really dont. Could I see her making it up? The odds are in that favor. Everything from Nelsons age when she began working at the Olde Hickory House where she claims the assault took place to the restaurants hours to the physical layout of the location Nelson says Moore assaulted her have been called into question aided by the testimony of former Old Hickory House employee Rhonda Ledbetter a waitress at Olde Hickory House for almost three years from 1977-1979 along with another former employee. In addition two former waitresses and two former customers say they never say Moore come into the restaurant despite Nelsons claim that he was there almost every night. According to Ledbetter Olde Hickory House required employees to be 16 years old. Nelson claims she was 15 when she started . . According to two former employees the dumpsters were on the side of the building. Nelson claimed that they were in the back. Olde Hickory House sat right off of the four-lane highway and had a wrap-around porch with lights all around it. Nelson claimed that the surroundings were dark and isolated. Rhonda Ledbetter who worked at Olde Hickory House for almost 3 years states that the earliest it closed was at 11 p.m. but she believes it was open until midnight . She is certain it did not close at 10:00 because Goodyear was next door and employees came to eat when their shift ended at 10 p.m. Nelson claims her story occurred after the restaurant closed at 10 p.m. . She is certain it did not close at 10:00 because Goodyear was next door and employees came to eat when their shift ended at 10 p.m. It is unlikely that there was an entrance from the back of the parking lot which Nelson claimed existed . Multiple sources have claimed that everyone parked on the sides of the building because there wasnt much room behind the restaurant according to Rhonda not enough room to turn around. Renee Schivera stated that a neighborhood backed up to the parking lot and it was adjacent to the backyards of peoples houses so she did not see how there would have been a back entrance as it would have gone through someones yard. . Multiple sources have claimed that everyone parked on the sides of the building because there wasnt much room behind the restaurant according to Rhonda not enough room to turn around. Nelson claimed that Judge Roy Moore came in almost every night and sat at the counter but former employees state that customers at the counter were served by the bartender or short order cook not served by the waitresses and had no reason to interact with the wait staff. Additionally two former waitresses and two former patrons state they never saw Judge Moore come into the restaurant. Other Moore accusers have been called out As Radio host Mark Levin pointed out on his show last week that there are several aspects of the case which dont really make sense. To recap; a Washington Post reporter overheard a rumor at a Roy Moore event in Alabama about Moore sexually abusing four girls 38 years ago then found the women interviewed them and the rest is history. Levin raised the following questions: How did the WaPo reporter know there were four women who they were and how to contact them? How is it that the reporter happened to overhear a rumor about four women who dont know each other and have never met yet the anonymous source the WaPo reporter ran into happened to know each girls story and how to contact them? yet the anonymous source the WaPo reporter ran into happened to know each girls story and how to contact them? Why hasnt any of this been reported in Moores 38 years in politics? And why now a month before an important election to fill Jeff Sessions senate seat? Adding to the list of questionable circumstances is the revelation that one of Moores accusers Debbie Gibson worked as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and is actively campaigning for Moores Democrat opponent Doug Jones. As New York Times bestselling author Attorney and Law professor James Hirsen points out: The Washington Post failed to disclose that one of Moores accusers was a sign language interpreter for Joe Biden and is a volunteer for Moores Democrat opponent. James Hirsen (@thejimjams) November 10 2017 Heres Gibson hard at work for Hillary: Another Moore accuser Leigh Corfman has claimed several pastors at various churches made sexual advances at her. This 3x divorcee who has also filed for bankruptcy three times. Purportedly Moores main accuser Leigh Corfman has had three divorces filed for bankruptcy three times and has been charged with multiple misdemeanors. Posts on Moores FB page indicate that Corfman has claimed several pastors at various churches made sexual advances at her. James Hirsen (@thejimjams) November 10 2017 The Star reports: She says that her teenage life became increasingly reckless with drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt when she was 16. As the years went on Corfman says she did not share her story about Moore partly because of the trouble in her life. She has had three divorces and financial problems. While living in Arizona she and her second husband started a screen-printing business that fell into debt. They filed for bankruptcy protection three times once in 1991 with $139689 in unpaid claims brought by the Internal Revenue Service and other creditors according to court records. In 2005 Corfman paid a fine for driving a boat without lights. In 2010 she was working at a convenience store when she was charged with a misdemeanor for selling beer to a minor. The charge was dismissed court records show. The WaPo reporter who penned the article wrote fake check according to an 2011 Red State report Ms. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown. Ms. McCrummens criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654 a violation of the Article 19 False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code.

The website named Its Going Down describes itself as a digital community center from anarchist anti-fascist autonomous anti-capitalist and anti-colonial movements. However several right-wing websites are placing an unproven connection between the so-called Antifa website and the recent tragic crash of the Amtrak Cascades train in Washington state. As reported by the Inquisitr the crash of Amtrak train No. 501 is the subject of an intensive investigation after passengers lost their lives due to the derailment. The above press conference showing Bella Dinh-Zarr of the NTSB shows Bella explaining that the Amtrak train was traveling at a rate of 80 miles per hour in an area of tracks that should have experienced speeds of only 30 miles per hour. In spite of that news Mike Cernovich created the below video pointing to a post on itsgoingdown.org that spoke of pouring concrete on train tracks in the area. Although Mike urged viewers not to automatically connect the Antifa post with the most recent Amtrak crash thats exactly whats happening from the thousands of folks sharing articles like those below on Facebook and other social media platforms. The post which was originally published to itsgoingdown.org/olympia-wa-train-tracks-sabotage-stop-fracking-equipment on April 20 has since been deleted. However snippets of the post that was shared to Facebook under the title Olympia WA: Train Tracks Sabotage To Stop Fracking Equipment can be seen below in Facebook previews and in a video. The post began by claiming that early in the morning of April 20th we poured concrete on the train tracks that lead out of the Port of Olympia to block any trains from using the tracks. ANTIFA group bragged about pouring concrete on train tracks in now deleted post https://t.co/yOSPd1OWdz Mike Cernovich ???????? (@Cernovich) December 18 2017 As reported by Snopes the theory that Antifa could have caused the Amtrak train crash is currently unproven. That hasnt stopped articles like Antifa Website Admitted To Pouring Concrete On Amtrak Tracks Could This Have Caused Derailment? by The Red Elephants from being shared more than 16000 times on Facebook since Monday. The article titled Amtrak Crash: Did AntiFa cause the train crash in Washington? by Project Republic Today has been shared more than 700 times. The Link Between Antifa and the [sic] Amtrack Train Wreck by Daily Herald News has gotten more than 400 shares in 11 hours. The far-right thinks antifa was behind the Amtrak train derailment by the DailyDot.com has gained more than 2000 shares since Monday with the latter seeming to make fun of how quickly some folks blamed Antifa for the tragedy. Cernovich claims that his theory was simply speculation. Further research by Snopes into the alleged claims about Antifa allegedly pouring concrete onto train tracks proved that its not clear whether the original claims ever happened.,,,0,0,,

The entertainment personality whos name gained prominence in political circles thanks to her feud with President Donald Trump tweeted: so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 This form of political bribery is a violation of 18 USC 201(b) which suggests ODonnells tweet could cost her up to 15 years in prison. The part of the law that ODonnell appears to have violated reads: Whoever (1)directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity with intent (A) to influence any official act; or (B) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing or collude in or allow any fraud or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud on the United States; or (C) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person; shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value whichever is greater or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years or both and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor trust or profit under the United States.

The New York Post reported that a government official briefed on the deadly Amtrack crash in Washington state says that the derailment may have been caused by an object intentionally placed on the track: A preliminary investigation suggests maintenance problems are unlikely to blame because the incident took place on brand-new tracks the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. As of this writing at least six people were killed but health officials expect the death toll to rise after several of the Amtrak 501 cars left the track with some spilling over a bridge railing onto busy U.S. Interstate 5 below. PJ Medias Debra Heine reported that ISIS shouldnt be the only terrorist group under suspicion for the derailment. She went on to point out that last April the anarchist group Its Going Down bragged online about sabotaging railroad tracks in the Pacific Northwest in order to block fracking equipment from reaching its destination (because you know having cheap energy and a booming economy isnt something that anarchists really support). Since Mondays derailment however the group deleted the post Heine noted further perhaps as a means of hiding its responsibility. Its Going Downs initial claim of sabotaging railroad tracks was supported by a Twitter account called Official Antifa which tweeted June 28: Here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on train tracks. We also include a how-to video at bottom of article. Here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on train tracks. We also include a how-to video at bottom of article:https://t.co/jToAfuL1vH pic.twitter.com/gUJdE2b9xL Official Antifa (@OfficialAntifa) June 28 2017 On April 20 under the headline Puget Sound Anarchists Its Going Down published this: Early in the morning of April 20th we poured concrete on the train tracks that lead out of the Port of Olympia to block any trains from using the tracks. We took precautions to notify BNSF (the train company) we called them and we used wires to send a signal that the tracks were blocked. We did this not to avoid damaging a train nothing would bring bigger grins to our faces but to avoid the risk of injuring railway workers. This action was done to disrupt the movement of trains carrying proppants used in natural gas fracturing. These train tracks are part of a system of pipelines fracking wells mines clearcuts control centers fiberoptics dams highways and factories that cover the planet and are physical manifestations of a process that is destroying the ecosystems cultures and inhabitants everywhere. The same Puget Sound group claimed solidarity with rail sabotage near Medford Oregon in November The Gateway Pundit reported. Naturally the post was submitted anonymously because well anarchists are cowards. Its a safe bet that U.S. intelligence agencies and the Department of Homeland Security along with the portion of the FBI that hasnt been politically corrupted by Barack Obama are aware of this group and its threats. Its also a safe bet that U.S. authorities are investigating the possible terrorism angle to Mondays derailment. (Related: FINALLY: FBI launching terrorism probe into Antifa criminals.) But whats not clear is just how far these idiots are prepared to go in order to push their warped dangerous agenda. Because if Antifa or Antifa-aligned groups are responsible for Mondays derailment they just crossed a big fat red line that makes them fair game for the rest of us who love our country and who want nothing more than to help the Trump administration bring them to justice. We cant have Alt-Left terrorist idiots sabotaging trains or destroying other infrastructure sectors. So if thats what happened all of us who love our country have an obligation to help find them and bring them to justice. J.D.

Whats more lithium release has been taking place on and off since the 1970s Rowland admits on the video which is actually a taped recording of a phone call.Though Rowland said that lithium does not hurt the environment the compound itself was used as a psychiatric medication for decades. It works by altering levels of serotonin and norepinephrine that are secreted by the human endocrine system. Lithium strongly alters brain patterns but in the recording Rowland claimed that ""it is not dangerous.""The reality is that even physicians who regularly prescribe the drug for psychiatric reasons dont understand how it works or what the proper dosing levels should be. So how can spraying large amounts of the compound into the atmosphere indiscriminately ever be a good thing?NASA has the explanation. On the space agencys website it claims that NASA pursues lithium releases in order to study wind movement in the upper atmosphere with the purpose being to analyze data about charged or ionized gas (called plasma) as well as the neutral gas that it travels through.The agency says that the variations matter because all GPS and communications satellites send their signals through the ionosphere and ""a disturbed ionosphere translates to disturbed signals"" so it is necessary to know what causes the ionosphere to act in certain ways.Besides mind-altering lithium others have tried aerosol vaccines spraying populations with vaccines without their knowledge or permission as this study abstract denotes. Several thousand people have been aerosol-vaccinated ""for many years"" in Russia with ""live-attenuated strains against many diseases."" Also there have been exhaustive field trials in South America using live-attenuated measles vaccine which were reported successful. Good results were also reported using an aerosol to vaccinate against influenza A.""The aerosol mode of vaccine introduction which best follows the natural route of many infections may first lead to development of immunity at the portal of entry and may also induce a more generalized defense"" the researchers stated.The study noted further that the optimal method of aerosol vaccine is through the nose which is considered better for pediatric and geriatric populations.""We conclude that aerosol immunization seems a promising method of vaccination"" the studys authors conclude.As for the lithium it is not a drug that should be spread throughout the atmosphere because again doctors and scientists really dont know what dose levels are effective and which are too much.Rowland in his taped conversation promised to respond to specific questions if he was emailed. He also said that the space agency welcomed such inquiries from the general public because informing people is a core mission of NASA.If thats true then why are other government employees in key agencies under gag orders regarding discussions of chemtrails If youre still not ready to believe that the U.S. government is capable of distributing aerosol lithium thermite via chemtrail this public document Code 840 RMMO from the Wallops Range and Mission Management Office should put your doubts to rest. It specifically states in a 2013 mission statement that the ""purpose"" of the launch is ""to test the loading methods for lithium canisters"" that were to be flown in subsequent missions. The results? ""Thermistor data looked nominal. Good report from airborne optical platform ofalso visible by ground observation.""The U.S. government has treated Americans as guinea pigs in the past; anyone who would think that it has discontinued the practice is just naive.",,,0,0,,

Alt-left terror group has disturbing history of railway sabotage Antifa is a radical anti-Trump left-wing terrorism group that has been praised by CNN and the left-wing media and now it looks likely that Antifa was responsible for the Amtrak train derailment south of Seattle Washington which has so far killed at least six people and injured nearly eighty. (See evidence below.) (Follow all the news on Antifa at Antifa.news.) In August of this year we proclaimed that Antifa should be declared a domestic terrorism organization. Yahoo News a radical left-wing news cult staffed by delusional obedient left-wing propagandists went on to endorse the Antifa terrorist organization with a glowing review joining fake news leader CNN which also endorsed Antifa as part of its effort to destroy America and overthrow the results of a democratic election that put Trump into office. Not long after undercover footage caught Antifa terrorism operatives planning to trap conservatives in kill zones where they could be dispatched with deadly weapons. In just the last two years at least ten journalists have been violently assaulted by Antifa whackos and the owner of left-leaning Whole Foods now owned by Dr. Evil globalist Jeff Bezos began promoting and profiting from the sales of terror-inspired Antifa gear. (Yes Whole Foods is now part of the deranged radical Left just like the Washington Post and CNN) Many of Americas leftist universities are now well documented to function as terrorist recruitment hubs for Antifa terrorist groups and in September of 2017 the FBI and DHS finally officially classified Antifa as being engaged in domestic terrorist violence. One Antifa leader / recruiter has been identified as a college professor named Mike Isaacson who openly endorses dead cops. Note that Antifa leaders and members routinely and openly call for extreme acts of violence against police the government and Trump supporters often justifying their death demands by claiming violence is necessary to convert America to a left-wing communist nation by murdering those who oppose their radical political views. Any who oppose Antifa are labeled Nazis which is then used to justify their murder. Antifas history of railway sabotage now comes to light with these shocking facts Now in the aftermath of the deadly Amtrak derailment in Dupont Washington we have learned shocking facts that point to Antifas role in the deadly terrorism act that has spilled blood in Washington: Antifa sabotaged a train in Olympia Washington claiming the train was transporting fracking supplies. In true left-wing Antifa style 20 30 protesters reportedly camped out on the railroad tracks to disrupt rail transport. They then hailed the disruption as a victory for left-wing justice. This was all covered in The Olympian a local paper. The Washington Post a radical left-wing anti-America publisher also owned by globalist Jeff Bezos who owns the Whole Foods that profited from selling terrorist Antifa gear published a glowing review of Antifas domestic terrorism activities all but encouraging them to carry out more such acts. The Antifa-echoing website Puget Sound Anarchists bragged about sabotaging trains in Washington claiming During this week we attached wire and jumper cables to the main Union Pacific rail line running through the state of Nebraska to disrupt rail signals and delay trains that mainly carry coal from the mountainous west to population centers in the east.

Now it seems that war has begun in Washington where the derailment of this train in light of all the threats and sabotage that has been carried out by Antifa groups is no mere coincidence. Antifa has shifted to active domestic terrorism against Americas civilians. The insanity of left-wing universities and anti-Trump hysteria has reached a new level of extreme danger for innocent Americans. This derangement whipped up by the late-night lunatic Jimmy Kimmel and other TV hate speech entertainers is now placing all Americans in the path of the Lefts insatiable appetite for slaughter. Today its a commuter train tomorrow it may be a jumbo jet an airport or a sports stadium. There is no limit to what Antifa can justify carrying out as theyve already labeled any who oppose them fascists and therefore excused their murder. In this way the extreme Left in America has become a dangerous cult of deranged delusional maniacs who see themselves as revolutionaries who seek the rise of communism to overthrow this nations existing government. Just yesterday in fact BuzzFeeds U.K. science editor a completely deranged lunatic named Kelly Oakes tweeted All I want for Christmas is full Communism now. As TheWrap.com reported: A spokesperson for BuzzFeed declined to comment on the matter. Oakes who does not report to the websites U.S.-based science desk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Critics pointed out that Communism as practiced by the Soviet Union China and North Korea has led to the deaths of over 100 million people according to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. Keep in mind that this deranged lunatic is BuzzFeeds science editor! Yes to the Left being a mentally deranged lunatic does not necessarily disqualify anyone from commenting on climate change abortion or the genetics of biological gender. (Thats because the Left has completely abandoned all real science in favor of mob-mentality surges of screaming crybullies who make irrational demands while declaring they alone have a monopoly on consensus because of their sheer numbers.) Media outlets that encouraged and promoted Antifa The radicalized Left in America has become at best a hate group. At worst its now a terrorist organization. And it has long enjoyed the support of left-wing media organizations and internet giants including: Yahoo! News CNN Washington Post New York Times The Huffington Post MSNBC Google YouTube Facebook Twitter BuzzFeed These journo-terrorism organizations (and many more) continue to promote and encourage the maniacal violence of the deranged Left. From the recent irrational insanity over Net Neutrality to the outright hoax of Russia collusion with the Trump campaign the deranged Left has devolved into an organized hate group that has now spurred its most extreme members Antifa to carry out deadly acts of terrorism on U.S. soil. Should it be proven that the Amtrak derailment was a deliberate act of sabotage all these left-wing media outlets will have been complicit in these tragic deaths. They contributed to the hatred and even published glowing articles about Antifa terrorists while refusing to denounce their tactics of violence and destruction. Thats why Ive called the left-wing media journo-terrorism. Arrest all Antifa members nationwide: Round them up lock them up and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law If it is established that Antifa deliberately sabotaged that Amtrak train this realization should unleash a nationwide manhunt for all Antifa members and recruiters including the ones on college campuses across the country. Its time to arrest these domestic extremists and for once tell them that society will no longer tolerate their crybully tactics. All members of Antifa should be rounded up locked up and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law (which should now include the charge of murder for those directly involved in Washington). If the police need assistance in this process I have no doubt that millions of Americans would support activating the National Guard for this purpose. Some college campuses are truly terror recruiting hubs that need to be rooted out cleaned out and restored to institutions of higher education. We the People can no longer allow these deranged dangerous Leftists to go unchallenged as they attempt to carry out acts of mayhem and murder across this nation (in the name of justice of course). They must be identified arrested and imprisoned. These left-wing lunatics run the gamut from murderers to terrorists and they openly despise democracy liberty the U.S. Constitution and any person exhibiting political opposition to their left-wing fascist goals. In truth these anti-fascists are themselves todays most poignant echo of the Third Reich and its reign of terror over innocents. In their deranged quest to bring justice to America Antifa members have become the very thing they claim to despise: Genocidal fascists who are a threat to everyone else in a civilized society. Theres one thing American soldiers learned in World War II that should be remembered today: The way to deal with genocidal fascists is to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem make a plan of attack and go take them out until youve utterly destroyed their ability to continue operations. This needs to be done now in America or we may lose this country to actual communists who are meticulously working to overthrow this nation from within. Stay informed as this story unfolds. Here are some of the most important websites to keep reading. Avoid all mainstream media sites as they are now almost universally working with the terrorists and are deliberately publishing fake news every day: Antifa.news Covers Antifa actions and crimes. FarLeftWatch.com Documents the crimes and mass mental illness of the far left. TheGatewayPundit.com Probably the best political news site on the web today with a special knack for quickly exposing left-wing insanity. LeftCult.com Details the cult-like philosophies and activities of deranged Leftists. FrontPageMag.com A hard-hitting journalism site that has exposed many of the terror recruiters working inside Americas universities.

America may well have suffered yet another terrorist attack on Monday only this one may not have involved anyone from an Islamist extremist faction: It could have come from domestic terrorists belonging to or in cahoots with Antifa. The New York Post reported that a government official briefed on the deadly Amtrack crash in Washington state says that the derailment may have been caused by an object intentionally placed on the track: A preliminary investigation suggests maintenance problems are unlikely to blame because the incident took place on brand-new tracks the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. As of this writing at least six people were killed but health officials expect the death toll to rise after several of the Amtrak 501 cars left the track with some spilling over a bridge railing onto busy U.S. Interstate 5 below. PJ Medias Debra Heine reported that ISIS shouldnt be the only terrorist group under suspicion for the derailment. She went on to point out that last April the anarchist group Its Going Down bragged online about sabotaging railroad tracks in the Pacific Northwest in order to block fracking equipment from reaching its destination (because you know having cheap energy and a booming economy isnt something that anarchists really support). Since Mondays derailment however the group deleted the post Heine noted further perhaps as a means of hiding its responsibility. Its Going Downs initial claim of sabotaging railroad tracks was supported by a Twitter account called Official Antifa which tweeted June 28: Here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on train tracks. We also include a how-to video at bottom of article. Here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on train tracks. We also include a how-to video at bottom of article:https://t.co/jToAfuL1vH pic.twitter.com/gUJdE2b9xL Official Antifa (@OfficialAntifa) June 28 2017 On April 20 under the headline Puget Sound Anarchists Its Going Down published this: Early in the morning of April 20th we poured concrete on the train tracks that lead out of the Port of Olympia to block any trains from using the tracks. We took precautions to notify BNSF (the train company) we called them and we used wires to send a signal that the tracks were blocked. We did this not to avoid damaging a train nothing would bring bigger grins to our faces but to avoid the risk of injuring railway workers. This action was done to disrupt the movement of trains carrying proppants used in natural gas fracturing. These train tracks are part of a system of pipelines fracking wells mines clearcuts control centers fiberoptics dams highways and factories that cover the planet and are physical manifestations of a process that is destroying the ecosystems cultures and inhabitants everywhere. The same Puget Sound group claimed solidarity with rail sabotage near Medford Oregon in November The Gateway Pundit reported. Naturally the post was submitted anonymously because well anarchists are cowards. Its a safe bet that U.S. intelligence agencies and the Department of Homeland Security along with the portion of the FBI that hasnt been politically corrupted by Barack Obama are aware of this group and its threats. Its also a safe bet that U.S. authorities are investigating the possible terrorism angle to Mondays derailment. (Related: FINALLY: FBI launching terrorism probe into Antifa criminals.) But whats not clear is just how far these idiots are prepared to go in order to push their warped dangerous agenda. Because if Antifa or Antifa-aligned groups are responsible for Mondays derailment they just crossed a big fat red line that makes them fair game for the rest of us who love our country and who want nothing more than to help the Trump administration bring them to justice. We cant have Alt-Left terrorist idiots sabotaging trains or destroying other infrastructure sectors. So if thats what happened all of us who love our country have an obligation to help find them and bring them to justice. J.D.

Ms. Nelson said on Nov. 13 that four decades ago when she was 16 and he was a 30-year-old assistant district attorney Mr. Moore assaulted her in his car putting his hands on her breasts and trying to force her head into his crotch squeezing her neck so hard she was bruised. Photo She is one of several women who have stepped forward to say that Mr. Moore pursued them sexually or romantically when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s including one who said he groped her when she was 14. As evidence that they knew each other Ms. Nelson produced the yearbook with an inscription in cursive writing that said: To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas 1977. Love Roy Moore. After the signature was printed D.A. and below it was written 12-22-77 Olde Hickory House with those words also printed. At the news conference on Nov. 13 Ms. Allred read out loud the entire entry not making a distinction between the different parts. On Friday she said that Ms. Nelson added the printed parts to remind herself who Roy Moore was and where and when Mr. Moore signed her yearbook. She never said that he wrote that Ms. Allred added. But the Moore camp claimed vindication referring in a statement to the Nelson yearbook forgery. On Twitter the candidate wrote of Ms. Nelson she admits lying though she had made no such admission. The allegations against Mr. Moore have turned what should have been an easy Republican win in a deep-red state into a close race threatening to erode the partys slim 52-to-48 Senate majority. The seat came open when Jeff Sessions was appointed United States attorney general. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nine women have said that Mr. Moore made unwanted advances toward them or worse when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s and in trying to discredit them the Moore campaign has focused on challenging the veracity of Ms. Nelson and the yearbook inscription. The apparent difference in the lettering of the inscription has spawned weeks of amateur analyses and conspiracy theories and has led Mr. Moore to repeatedly suggest the yearbook was a fake. The yearbook landed back in the spotlight on Friday when a reporter for Good Morning America asked Ms. Nelson if she had added her own notes beneath the inscription and she said that she had.

There are a lot of Alabamians who are looking for any piece of evidence to say this was all an attempt to trash the name of Roy Moore and there will be a lot of people who do seize on it and try to make that argument said Elizabeth BeShears a Republican consultant in Alabama who said she believes Mr. Moores accusers. The tide has turned in his favor in the last week and a half or so Ms. BeShears said and I think this really will probably help him. As Mr. Moore struggled to discredit the allegations which initially repulsed some voters and prompted Republicans in Washington including Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader to call for Mr. Moore to drop out of the race his allies focused on Ms. Nelsons yearbook. Ms. Allred has said that she would release the yearbook only to a Senate committee investigating the charges against Mr. Moore if such an inquiry was to begin. Mr. Jauregui has demanded that she turn it over to an independent forensic analyst who can he said on Friday determine is the ink is a month old or is it 40 years old? The news came at the end of a week in which Mr. Moore enjoyed a new infusion of support from the Republican Party including an endorsement by President Trump and resumption of funding from the Republican National Committee which had severed ties with his campaign last month. Paula Cobia a lawyer for Gloria Deason who has said Mr. Moore took her on dates and ordered her alcohol when she was 18 said Ms. Nelsons admission had not undermined Ms. Deasons story or that of the other accusers. The inscription and his signature look completely authentic. The fact that she might have written and she says that she did the Olde Hickory House or whatever underneath it so what? Ms. Cobia asked.

The penalty? For Rosie she could spend up to 15 years in jail suffer a lifetime ban from elective office and pay up to a cool $12 million according to reports. 18 U.S. Code 201 Bribery of public officials and witnesses is pretty clear in defining this crime. Any attempt to influence a public officials public act with an offer of something of value is bribery and a felony. ODonnell offered 4 million dollars which is something of value to get two Senators who are public officials to vote against a tax bill which is a public act. Shes guilty as hell of this. [] The punishment for attempting to bribe a public official is up to 15 years in prison and a fine of three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value. Since she offered 2 million to each senator thats 6 million a piece or 12 million total. But it gets more interesting since she also offered any Republican senator the same deal. There are 52 Republican Senators and at 2 million each that makes 104 million times 3 which is 312 million. In addition shed be looking at 52 cases of trying to bribe a public official so she could also face 780 years in prison. via NY Daily News: FBI officials neither confirm nor deny investigations. Most prosecutors would use their discretion [Rebecca] Roiphe [a New York law school professor] said look at the context of the political situation and not even interview ODonnell. It all rides on what her intent was in writing that tweet she told the News. And trying to buy influence isnt the point of this whole string of these tweets. What shes trying to do is fake-offer a bribe to point out that theyve already been politically been bought. It is illegal to offer money to public officials with the intent to influence official acts like voting on a bill. Do you think that she should answer for this?

False RATING False ORIGIN On 5 May 2017 the The Last Line of Defense web site (and subsequently related shill sites such as USA Politics Now) published an article reporting that Malia Obama the daughter of former president Barack Obama had been arrested with a gang of thugs in Chicago on charges related to dogfighting: Malia Obama may have done irreparable harm to her career this morning when she decided to join a gang of thugs in Chicago for a day of drinking drugs and dogfighting at a public park in Chicago. Malia was arrested along with seven others and charged with wanton endangerment of animals public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance. She was found in the company of mostly older men when police arrived after being called by a concerned citizen complaining about a loud group of people watching dogs fight in the park According to the Secret Service Malia had slipped away late last night after being told open air parties at public parks were too dangerous. She wasnt seen again until she showed up in the 12th precinct jail. her parents havent been available for comment. In August 2017 the Land of the Free fake news site ran the same false story changing Malias alleged offense from a dogfighting-related one to a drug-related one: Apparently Malias weed habit has gotten worse because she was just caught in a massive marijuana bust in her home city of Chicago Illinois. Malia was caught buying weed edibles from two of her thug friends as well as enough pot to make thug rapper Snoop Dogg look like an amateur according to sources within Chicagos elite Drug Task Force. These reports of the former First Daughters arrest were completely fabricated and the image appended to them as proof that Malia Obama had been arrested in Chicago was a photograph of an October 2013 dogfighting ring bust which was digitally altered to insert a picture of her face in place of one of the original suspects: The Last Line of Defense (The Resistance) is a fake news site that consistently dupes social media users with fabricated stories despite the presence of a disclaimer disclosing its satirical nature: The Resistance may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that dont necessarily exist.

ODonnell was taken into custody Wednesday morning and charged with two counts of attempting to bribe a public official which carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison per count. ODonnell was released on her own recognizance but her nightmare is just beginning. Soon shell learn that bribing public officials is a serious thing. None of those reports was true.

Thomas Wictor a brilliant author and journalist immediately called out the signature in her yearbook as a forgery according to the Gateway Pundit. Liberals blasted him and Moore supporters for even daring to doubt the testimony of an (alleged) rape victim. But now the truth is out because Beverly Nelson herself has come out and ADMITTED that the signature in her yearbook was in fact FORGED. On Friday ABC News interviewed Nelson when she openly confessed that she had fabricated part of the high school yearbook inscription. Listen carefully the reporter coaches her and puts words in her mouth as she agrees that she added some notes to the inscription but the liberal slime network completely glazes straight past the stunning bombshell: Beverly Young Nelson one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct tells @GMA it sickens her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8 2017 From Breitbart News: Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription ABC News tells us. But the message was all Roy Moore. Beverly he signed your yearbook ABC News reporter Tom Llamas says. He did sign it she replies. And you made some notes underneath. Yes Nelson says. And then after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence. Nelson tells the ABC News reporter that she wrote part of the note that she and her infamous pro-Clinton lawyer Gloria Allred have used to incriminate Moore. Despite admitting that she added notes to the inscription Nelson is still adamant in her charge that it was Moore who signed the yearbook. He did sign it Nelson told ABCs Tom Llamas. According to the New York Post she forged the date and location of the signature adding 12-22-77 and Olde Hickory House the restaurant where Nelson worked and where she said the Moore was at that time a regular customer. Who signs a yearbook in December anyways? This is a devastating bombshell. Roy Moore and his supporters were RIGHT ALL ALONG. With the election only four days away this report couldnt have come at a better time coupled with the presidents endorsement and the return of the RNCs backing voters are going to the polls with the fresh memory of Nelsons bald-faced lies. Nelson is accusing Moore of having attempted to grope and rape her inside of a locked car when she was 16 years old. This story however was already completely debunked even before this shock report came out cars were not designed with childproof locks until three years after this incident allegedly took place Rush Limbaugh noted. Moore completely denied the accusers account and has denied that he ever even knew the woman claiming that the entire signature is a forgery. I can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false. I never did what she said I did. I dont even know the woman. I dont know anything about her. I dont even know where the restaurant is or was he said. This is a political maneuver Moore added. It has nothing to do with reality. The Liberal Establishment has honed in on Moores signature in the yearbook as definitive proof somehow that he sexually abused her. Thats right: yearbook signatures are now considered sexual harassment. What a world we live in! Nelson also has a possible motivation (besides a political one or being paid-off by the Liberal Establishment) Moore ruled against her as a circuit judge in 1999 when he presided over her divorce case. The Moore campaign was demanding for weeks that Nelson and her lawyer turn in the yearbook for third party examination. Now we can all clearly see why they never submitted it! ABC News was disgraced again when reporter Brian Ross delivered a bombshell report that Donald Trump had commanded Michael Flynn to contact the Russians during his presidential campaign only to later retract a tiny (but crucial detail) on air that the contact hadnt actually come until Trump was president-elect a completely normal affair and not an impeachable offense.

Nelson still claims that Judge Moore wrote most of the message and signed it but admits she made notes to it. The old saying always expect the unexpected does not apply to Alabama politics. Its more like expect the expected. Whether or not a claim is credible or false you can always expect some type of mud to be thrown at one of the candidates. One year the Democrat candidate ran a campaign ad against Justice Harold See in the state Supreme Court race that featured a skunk in the ad to insinuate that See was a skunk. Cant make this stuff up folks! While it was one of the lower points of Alabama politics Justice See went on to win that election. Now we know why Gloria Allred would not release the year book for an independent handwriting analysis to determine what Ms. Nelson has admitted: its a forgery. Many of the claims such as Roy Moore was banned from the Gadsden Mall and the forged yearbook inscription have been reported on The Trump Times. Now lets see how long and how few of the mainstream news media will cover this bombshell of an admission in favor of Judge Moore. Having this latest claim proven false it could not happen at a better time for Judge Moore. Just in time for the weekend newspapers media shows and after church lunch discussions. This latest development will only bolster the argument that Democrats aided by Sen. Mitch McConnell and establishment Republicans tried to derail Judge Moore at all costs. And for that the good people of Alabama will not take too kindly. Alabama voters go to the polls this coming Tuesday December 12 to vote for their next United States Senator. I will still stick to my initial estimate that Moore will win by 6-8% of the vote leaning closer to eight. When I need to get a clear perspective I make a call to Fayette AL to a longtime friend of mine. He has been active in Alabama politics back when it wasnt cool to be a Republican when the state was controlled by Democrats and before he decided to kick back and relax. During a phone conversation earlier today he said I wonder how Gloria Allred is going to turn this lemon into lemonade?,,,0,0,,

Neither senator took her up on the offer and both voted in favor of the tax bill but ODonnell was nonetheless accused of openly trying to bribe sitting politicians. However legal experts tell TheWrap the actress and former The View co-host isnt in any serious danger of being charged for bribery. Also Read: Rosie ODonnell Dragged for Offering $4 Million to 2 GOP Senators If They Voted Against Tax Bill (They Didnt) According to Philadelphia-based attorney Lathrop B. Nelson who has written about bribery and corruption cases ODonnells offer looks like attempted bribery if you just sort of check the boxes off. But he says she would be able to make a strong case that her offer as a political statement and not an actual offer of money in exchange for political favors. What you really need to take a look at is the intent factor and requirement to be convicted of a bribery charge Nelson says. And you know she does say I promise she does say no st and she does make a specific request for Susan Collins and Jeff Flake to direct message her. so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake if they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million cash each ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20 2017 But if I was Rosies counsel Nelson continued I would make a very strong argument that this is political discourse on Twitter without any real intent at all to commit a violation of the bribery statute. And while she may have been trying to make a political statement which I would have advised her not to make I think there is a very good argument here that she did not have the intent to pay them $2 million. Asked for comment a representative for ODonnell referred TheWrap to a subsequent tweet that appears to support the argument the actress was making a political statement: Also Read: Rosie ODonnell Goes Off on Estranged Daughter Chelsea After Scathing Interview Nelson added: The way to successfully bribe someone or attempt to bribe someone is not to tweet something obviously. Abby K. Wood an associate professor of law political science and public policy at USCs Gould School of Law tells TheWrap that while ODonnell may have been serious in her tweet its unlikely to be taken seriously. In part because law enforcement likely has more serious priorities and in part because its exemplary of the crazy year were in. At any given time theyve got prosecutors working on corruption cases actual corruption cases Wood says. Which is why you arent seeing serious commenters making it an issue on Twitter. Woods added this is another totally bananas example of 2017 which has been characterized by some pretty serious stuff being said out loud that you should never say out loud. Also Read: Rosie ODonnells Ex-Wife Michelle Rounds Dies at 46 Trump tweets out stuff that incriminates him for things all the time Woods continued calling it just another example of what a crazy year were in. If the offer became public as part of an investigation Woods says the public might see it differently. But if she tweets it out were rolling our eyes. Jessica Tillipman an assistant dean at the George Washington University Law School who teaches an anti-corruption seminar said she doesnt think ODonnell actually knows the laws or that she would be stupid enough to do that if she knew the laws which would be important context for law enforcement. Part of the reason the U.S. has bribery laws is to ensure politicians act in the best interest of their constituents Tillipman says. In this forum a public proclamation of Im gonna give you $2 million prosecutors would have to demonstrate corruption here and what she was intending to actually do even if shes making it pretty clear shes serious adds the GW dean. I dont think she actually knows the laws or that she would be stupid enough to do that if she knew the laws Tillipman says arguing the exchange would need to be a real concrete plan. In the end she says it doesnt strike me as a good use of a prosecutors resources.,,,0,0,,

The twitter post in which she outlined her plans to send cash to GOP Senators was met with immediate backlash and has some mulling over whether or not the funny-woman might find herself behind bars for her antics. 2 million cash each ODonnells first post targeted Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) promising them no sh** 2 million cash each if they voted no on the reform bill. She then decided to spread her wings and try her luck with all of the Republicans in the upper house posting a follow-up tweet which read I will HAPPILY pay any GOP senator 2 million dollars to vote NO. Unfortunately for Rosie it seems that no one took her money as not a single GOP Senator voted against the bill which was passed early Wednesday morning. If Trump orders Sessions to investigate Rosie he will be carved into Rushmore by Friday. Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) December 20 2017 Despite the fact that her call went unanswered it is still possible that Ms. ODonnell did in fact commit a crime by offering politicians a cash payout in exchange for their votes. Federal law states that anyone who directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official in order to influence their position has committed a crime and it seems that this is exactly what we have seen here through Rosies tweet. It all rides on what her intent was According to New York Law School professor Rebecca Roiphe who spoke about the situation with the New York Daily News it all rides on what her intent was in writing that tweet and the comedian can very easily say that what she was doing was simply political commentary to jab at Senators who she believes have already been bought. RELATED: Senate Passes Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Most agree that the Justice Department will likely not be pursuing ODonnells attempted bribe and the Daily News reported that the FBI was unavailable for comment on the situation. According to the U.S. legal code however if the government does decide to prosecute bribery is a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $12 million. What do you think of Rosie ODonnells attempt to pay off Senators? Should she face legal consequences? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

During his time serving the United Kingdom he trained extensively as a mechanical engineer and munitions expert and claims to be seasoned in unconventional murders involving poisons and chemicals. The retired British assassin says he worked as part of a cell of seven operatives who were trusted to conduct political assassinations during a period he describes as when MI5 operated with less external oversight. Many of his top-secret cells victims were politicians journalists activists and union leaders.Mr. Hopkins claims that Princess Diana was the only women he ever killed adding that: She was the only target where the order came directly from the Royal family. When asked about how he felt about taking the life of The Peoples Princess he said he felt ambivalent about her death describing her as a beautiful kind-hearted women who had her life cut tragically short but that she was also placing the British Crown at risk saying: The Royal Family had evidence that she was planning to divorce Charles. She knew too many Royal Secrets. She had a huge grudge and she was going to go public with all sorts of wild claims. My boss told me she had to die hed received orders directly from Prince Philip and we had to make it look like an accident. Id never killed a woman before much less a princess but I obeyed orders. I did it for Queen and country. He claims the operation was run under strict control from Buckingham Palace in direct cooperation with the mainstream media. The high-level conspiracy involved collusion between the media and Palace to square their stories make sure everybody was on the same page. It was a well-run operation. Speaking about the conspirators in the operation Hopkins said: British journalists all answer to editors who answer to oligarchs who all want knighthoods from the crime family at Buckingham Palace. There is no free press in Britain We got away with murder. After being told that he only has a short time left to live from his doctors Hopkins said he will spend his final weeks at home but admitted that he expects to be arrested after his admissions or even silenced saying: I cant say that I care an awful lot. If they try to take me out theyll be doing me a favor now He explained that he would be long-gone should an investigation be opened as it would take forever and be very complicated due to the limited records on the operations adding that most of my colleagues are already dead. Hopkins claims that the main conspirator in the murder of Princess Diana was Prince Philip but said that he will never be charged with anything of course. If Prince Philip ever lets himself be analyzed by a psychiatrist Im sure hed be diagnosed a psychopath. He has all the dark triad traits. Should this case ever be investigated the most important witness would be Mr. Hopkins boss who apparently died of a heart attack in the early 2000s. When Hopkins was asked why he didnt expose the plot earlier or refuse the job at the time he explained: MI5 agents swear allegiance to the Crown We cant be impartial when it comes to the Royal family. At best I would have been done for treason at worst Philip would have designed a grisly fate for me. Source: http://www.neonnettle.com,,,0,0,,

Some of the patients Ive administered the flu shot to this year have died the doctor said adding I dont care who you are this scares the crap out of me. We have seen people dying across the country of the flu and one thing nearly all of them have in common is they got the flu shot. Scientists were worried this years flu season was going to be rough and their fears have been proven well founded. The flu season is off to a record-breaking start with the CDC reporting widespread flu activity from coast to coast. Many health officials believe that 2018 will ultimately be the worst flu outbreak that we have experienced since 1918. The CDC doctors experience of patients dying of the flu after receiving the flu shot is sadly not uncommon. Eight Santa Barbara County residents have died from the flu in the last fortnight. Seven of them had the flu shot. This deadly pattern is replicating itself across the country. Yet health officials are still telling people to get the flu shot even though it does not work well this season. Officials have started admitting that the vaccine it is only 10% effective. The verdict is out on flu shots. Many medical experts now agree it is more important to protect yourself and your family from the flu vaccine than the flu itself. Every year the pharmaceutical industry medical experts and the mainstream media work hard to convince us to get vaccinated against the flu. 2018 is no different. But as usual were not being told the whole story. Pharmaceutical companies provide mainstream media outlets with a huge percentage of their advertising revenue. Big pharmaceutical companies actually spend far more on advertising than research. We are talking hundreds of billions of dollars. Big Pharmas dollars have effectively purchased the silence of mainstream media. You can no longer believe anything they say about pharmaceuticals especially vaccines. It is clear Big Pharma is desperate to ensure mainstream media outlets never tell us about adverse reactions or the toxic chemicals being injected into us in the flu shot. Flu vaccines contain dangerous ingredients The pharmaceutical industry medical experts and the mainstream media admit to us that flu vaccines contain strains of the flu virus. What they are less likely to reveal though is the long list of other ingredients that come with the vaccine. It is now a known fact that flu vaccines contain mercury a heavy metal known to be hazardous for human health. Mercury toxicity can cause depression memory loss cardiovascular diseases respiratory problems ADD oral health problems digestive imbalances and other serious health issues. The flu vaccines actually do not immunize but sensitize the body against the virus Have you ever noticed how vaccinated children get sick almost immediately following a vaccination? This is because the flu virus is introduced into their bodies. So rather than immunize the flu shot actually only sensitizes the body against the virus. And the fact that it causes individuals to get ill following a shot indicates immuno-suppression (i.e. lowering of the immunity). Makes you more susceptible to pneumonia and other contagious diseases For someone with an already suppressed immune system injecting strains of the flu virus can have devastating consequences. If your body is already working to fight off a virus or simply operating with low immunity a vaccine injection could put your body in serious danger of contracting influenza with stronger symptoms or even worse pneumonia and other contagious diseases. Weakens immunological responses There have been literally thousands of medical journal articles published that show injecting vaccines can lead to harmful immunological responses and a host of other infections. Moreover weak immunological responses only decrease a persons ability to fight the diseases that the vaccine was supposed to protect against in the first place. Serious neurological disorders Evidence now suggests that ingredients in flu vaccinations can actually cause serious neurological disorders. In 1976 a significant number of those who received the flu vaccine acquired Guillain-Barr Syndrome (GBS) a disorder characterized by permanent nerve damage and even paralysis. Flu vaccines can contain many harmful materials including detergent mercury formaldehyde and strains of live flu virus. Should you get a flu shot? If you are still prevaricating and wondering who to trust consider this: The very people pushing flu vaccinations and putting the fear of God into anybody who abstains are making billions of dollars each year. Are they the people we should be trusting with our health? In August 1999 the Committee on Government Reform initiated an investigation into Federal vaccine policy. This investigation focused on possible conflicts of interest on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The investigation concluded that many individuals serving on two key advisory committees had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines. Often these individuals were granted waivers to fully participate in the discussions that led to recommendations on vaccine licensing and adding vaccines to the Childhood Immunization Schedule. This in itself creates serious doubt as to how effective flu vaccines really are. This article was originally published by YourNewsWire.com,,,0,0,,

(Video) The Rod of God. A Directed Energy Weapon. Main stream presstituts will have you believe this was a meteor a meteor that fell at a perfect 90* angle. SMH.. This just happened a few hours ago in Taylor Michigan. 01/16/18 This energy blast was seen and heard in 4 US states and Canada. The United States Geological Survey reports a 2.0 magnitude earthquake at 8:09 p.m. January 16 2018 exactly the same time a meteor flashed through the sky in Michigan. The earthquake was a very weak earthquake having what is called a local magnitude (Ml) of 2.0. This USGS map shows a meteorite notation for the quake. A 2.0 magnitude earthquake would not be felt by humans. This is confusing because all the Meteor videos I can find for this day on YouTube show something else entirely than these photographs. The videos show like a regular ole meteor going thru the air. But these pictures show a percise ray of energy beamed down lighting the ground on fire. Could this be the same tech causing the wildfires all over the USA aka California etc? I dont know. That is why I am sharing this for discussion. Just In.. The meteor visuals from the news reports and videos do not line up with the pictures above. Seems like two seperate incidents on the same day. Im trying to get to the bottom of it. Here is another picture of the incident taken from an African American womans drive way of the same incident! What the hell is it? Look What I Found! Are the meteor and fire two seperate incidents? Police: 4 people die including 2 kids in Detroit-area fire ROSE TOWNSHIP Mich. (AP) Police say four people including two children have died in a fire at a home in suburban Detroit. Michigan State Police say two other people were seriously injured in the fire early Tuesday in Oakland Countys Rose Township. Police say the injured were taken to a hospital for treatment and at least one had severe burns. The cause of the fire wasnt immediately known. The North Oakland County Fire Authority says a man and woman believed to be in their mid-20s died along with the children. Names werent immediately released. State police spokesman Lt. Mike Shaw tells WWJ-AM that a neighbor called 911 to report the fire. He says the home about 40 miles northwest of Detroit was engulfed in flames by the time crews arrived.

He was added to the FBIs list of most wanted fugitives today becoming the first man from Robeson County to be added to the criminal lineup since 1950. Unlike others who have earned this anti-honor such as Osama bin Laden and Boston mob boss James E. Whitey Bulger he is suspected in the death of only one person. Wanted by the FBI: Brandon R. LeSane Lumberton homicide detectives told the FBI that the victim whose name has not been released was gathering his belongings from his car when a gunman approached from behind and shot him in the head. He died a short time later. The FBI is after LeSane for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. FBI officials call the jilted LeSane a master manipulator who recruited one of his co-conspirators after telling him that LeSane had cartel ties and could supply him with drugs as well as money and a car. The victim is said to be a high-ranking member of a rival cartel from the one that LeSane is believed to be associated with. Officials believe LeSane was also the getaway driver during the crime which happened on the night of July 25 2017 & he is now a fugitive. LeSane has been charged with capital murder. Brandon LeSane FBI Agents say that LeSane should be considered armed and dangerous. The FBI is offering up to a $100000 reward for information that leads directly to the arrest of LeSane.,,,0,0,,

Do you talk to your dog like a human being? Do you talk to your dog while doing household chores? Do you pretend they answer back just so you can have a two-sided conversation? While you may not be alone a multi-year study of the largest sample set to date by the University of Raddington reveals such odd behavior is a sign of developing dementia. Doctor Reginald Bampton and expert in human-pet psychology revealed the results of the study were quite stark and surprising. Well beyond statistical error he said. Dr. Bampton continued Of course dogs are not humans. They are not even on the same realm of intrinsic value. What our extensive study showed is people who talk to dogs on a regular basis at such a human level are losing their grip on reality. My colleague Dr. Stein noted the similarity to dementia sufferers. When we connected the dots it was eye opening! The University hopes the results of this study will serve as an early warning system for the onset of dementia and signs of early onset as well. We are preparing Public Service Announcements for community radio stations to play University Provost Sam Andrew said. It is our civic duty. The lesson to be learned is if you have human-like conversations with your dog or know some who does please get a mental acuity exam from a certified physician immediately.,,,0,0,,

745,http://christmasdailygifts.info/?p=309,https://www.snopes.com/government-to-microchip-citizens/,2016-12-17,378.0,false,It seems too far-fetched to be true especially in the land of the free where the Constitution supposedly recognizes and enshrines certain inalienable human rights like individual choice and privacy but its true nonetheless: In the United States we have all come one step closer to being microchipped by mandate. Six years ago NBC Nightly News boldly predicted that all Americans would be fitted with RFID microchips by the year 2017. Though at the time NBCs prediction seemed far-fetched the House recently passed a bill that would bring a micro-chipped populace closer to reality before years end. Which would allow the US attorney general to award grants to law enforcement for the creation and operation of locative tracking technology programs. H.R. 4919 would among other things authorize federal grants to local agencies to fund the voluntary use of tracking devices to locate and safeguard patients with dementia or developmental disabilities (such as autism). On 8 December 2016 the U.S. House of Representatives passed House Resolution 4919 a bill reauthorizing the Missing Alzheimers Disease Patient Alert Program a program that until it expired in 2013 provided federal grants to locally based agencies and organizations for the purposes of protecting and locating missing patients with Alzheimers disease and related dementia (with an added provision supporting the same services for missing patients with developmental disabilities such as autism). The bill is known as Kevin and Avontes Law and the idea behind it is that mentally disabled people who are microchipped will be easy to locate if they get lost. This is a giant step toward universal microchipping of everyone. Unfortunately most Americans did not even realize that this bill was being discussed. H.R. 4919 which passed 346 to 66 in the lower chamber mandates the U.S. attorney general award grants to law enforcement officials so that those agencies can create establish and operate locative tracking technology programs. The bill was approved by a margin of almost 300 votes which means that it had support from representatives in both parties. Now we wait and see what the Senate will do and then it will be up to our President to either veto it or not. Giving police the authority to decide who is micro-chipped and who is not based on their mental soundness is a recipe for disaster. Though the bill specifically mentions those with Alzheimer and autism how long before these tracking programs are extended to those with ADHD and Bipolar disorder among other officially recognized disorders? Even the dislike of authority is considered a mental disorder known as Oppositional Defiant Disorder. In reality the bill opens the door to give police the ability to microchip dissenters and force cooperation on the part of the general population. In effect anyone who doesnt go along with the mass conditioning will be labeled mentally ill and branded with a track-and-control chip. At the first sign of suspicious behavior a troubling social media profile or a misunderstanding during an encounter police and medical personnel will have the authority to declare someone mentally disabled (or incapacitated or temporarily insane or unsound of mind or whatever label is handy) just because they express discontent anger or outage at the state of the world and political affairs. Fake news journalists can be shut down and conspiracy minded individuals controlled and of course it will be abused which will lead to a very nasty police state. The bills sponsor Republican Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey explained the motivation behind it as follows (in part): Having worked with the Alzheimers and Autism communities for years I know how important this program can be in advancing the health and safety of persons who wonder as well as advancing awareness and education about the problem Smith said. What is shocking is that while almost half of all children with autism wander from safety only half of those affected families have received any guidance or training on addressing the concern and keeping their child safe according to a study published in Pediatrics. Smith said the funding can be used to provide proactive educational programming to prevent wandering and assist in locating missing individuals as well as innovative locative technology to help find those who may wander. According to the Alzheimers Association half of Alzheimers patients who wander will suffer serious injury sometimes fatal if not found within the first 24 hours Smith noted. This legislation will provide funding to law enforcement agencies and non-profits to help implement locative tracking technology programs for individuals with dementia/disability and implement a notification or communications system of alerts he said. Though the programs mission is to find individuals with forms of dementia or children with developmental disabilities who have wandered from safe environments it provides no restriction on the tracking programs inclusion of other individuals. The bill would also require the attorney general to work with the secretary of health and human services and unnamed health organizations to establish the best practices for the use of tracking devices. The government will decide who is mentally unfit and must be tracked That prediction doesnt appear to have come trueand with Hillary Clinton soundly defeated Nov. 8 it doesnt look like it will happen anytime soon. But what if it did? What if somehow some of us began to be chipped sold to us as a way to enhance public safety (which is always the excuse government uses to take away our rights and freedoms)? Dont look now but it just happened. In other words the legislationknown as Kevin and Avontes Lawmakes it legal for police to track certain U.S. citizens despite the fact that their privacy is guaranteed by the Constitutions Fourth Amendment. The program which many have likened to the opening of a Pandoras Box of wider tracking in the future gives local police the authority to use technology to locate individuals with forms of dementia such as Alzheimers disease or children with developmental disabilities such as autism who have wandered from safe environments. Advocates of the legislation including Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee D-Texas and Rep. Chris Smith R-N.J. say the measure can help police intervene to avert tragedies through the use of location technology before the mentally disabled wander into trouble. But opponents like Rep. Louie Gohmert R-Texas see it as a way for government to broadly interpret how it uses the technology. As noted by the Daily Caller in recent days the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill that would require the U.S. attorney general to provide grants to local law enforcement agencies so they can create establish and operate locative tracking technology programs. While this initiative may have noble intentions small and temporary programs in the name of safety and security often evolve into permanent and enlarged bureaucracies that infringe on the American peoples freedoms he said. That is exactly what we have here. A safety problem exists for people with Alzheimers autism and other mental health issues so the fix we are told is to have the Department of Justice start a tracking program so we can use some device or method to track these individuals 24/7. Later Gohmert said the bills sponsors implore lawmakers and the American people not to worry because it has language saying that any tracking device cannot be invasive and is totally voluntary. Whats to stop some future authoritarian from widening a tracking program? But he added that he was confused as to why Republican majorities in both chambers of Congressthe party historically at odds with big government and the massive federal bureaucracywould be taken in and fooled into approving yet another massive invasive government program. He was also astounded that the GOP-controlled Congress would allow the tracking of people with developmental disabilitiesa term that could have very broad applicationsbut not approve any tracking of illegal aliens criminals and other malcontents. Therein lies the rub: Who gets to define mentally incapacitated? And is that description only limited to persons who have been medically clinically diagnosed with a mental problem? Because in the recent past Left-wing activists politicians and academics have accused alternative media types of being mentally deranged and propagandists. Should alternative media journalists be tracked for the publics safety? Its not that farfetched anymore to think that could happen someday especially when a program establishing official tracking of certain persons has already been implemented.

According to University of Alabama president Mark Heller the decision was made to remove Mr. Scarborough from the team following his outburst which does not represent the values of this institution. This is bad news for the anti-Trump player who was attending U of A on a combination of an athletic scholarship and financial aid. The school refuses to give further information on Scarboroughs removal citing student privacy. Things might get much worse for Scarborough as he may have run afoul of a school policy that could see him paying a fine of up to $2500. He may have also violated a local ordinance requiring performers to limit the public use of foul language. This carries a penalty of up to 40 hours community service and $1000 in fines. Its good to see schools no longer tolerating attacks on our President and our country. Keep it up U of A!,,,0,0,,

This journalist checked for Mohammed and its alternative spellings. He thus counted: Mohammed 221 Mohamed 211 Muhammed 110 Mohammad 51 Muhammad 43 and reached a total of 636. Other forms like Mohamad Muhamed Muhammet Mouhamed Muhamad and Mahamuud could not be checked for privacy reasons. Of course other forms of Noah like Noa and Noach should be checked as well for the sake of fairness: both however were not listed according to the Dutch journalist. The author says it is the second year in a row that Mohammed is the most popular name for baby boys: In 2016 there were 724 babys named Mohammed (or one of its Arabic alternatives) in the Netherlands. He also mentions that the same tendency was seen in England in 2016: It is not Oliver but Mohammed (with all its permutations) that is the most popular name for baby boys.,,,0,0,,

Simpson who was armed with a pistol and a knife was carrying a fake Canadian passport and nearly $400K in cash. He would have slipped across the border unnoticed with his established coyote friend from town who knows all of the US Customs officers at the border which consists of what looks like a four-lane tollbooth had he not stopped for a drink. It was there in town that someone recognized him after everyone involved had too much to drink. OJ Simpson!: said the townie Whats it like to kill somebody? Simpson didnt take kindly to the answer and smashed a beer bottle across the poor kids head. Within minutes the clubs bouncers had Simpson outside where New York State Police determined that he was in violation of his parole in Nevada and considered a fugitive from justice. He was booked into the local county jail in Fishkill as Transfer 573. US Marshals will usher him back to Nevada in the morning where hell answer federal charges before being brought to his parole officers mercy. It is likely that hell never see freedom again.,,,0,0,,

This rumor began circulating as soon as Trump was elected President of the United States but these idiots continue to push the matter. Our message to them DO IT. We dont need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie ODonnell think that the movie and television industry wouldnt survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are. Mike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry. He mentioned the lower paid support staff who do all of the behind the scenes work. The people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets who make the costumes who create the props and in some cases do the stunts and the special effects Mike explained. And theyre not getting the bazillion dollar deals. Its about time that these jerkoffs realize that they arent the only people in this world. The fact remains that Donald Trump is our President whether they like it or not and that isnt about to change.,,,0,0,,

Federal debt skyrocketed under Obama. He was printing money by the end of his reign. This is unheard of in our history. He ran the country like a banana republic said Denzel Washington at a New York screening of his new film the legal drama Roman J. Israel Esq. Asked by a reporter whether his information about Obama was correct Denzel Washington confirmed that it was absolutely correct. He also criticized mainstream media for attempting to turn Obama into a kind of idol. Why arent they discussing the facts? They think we are too stupid to understand the metrics? Denzel Washington said explaining that he had seen a segment about Obamas legacy that blew my mind and left me raging. There were more ready-and-willing workers out of the labor force than ever before by the time that guy left office. Obama blew it for America big time and now they are trying to portray him as some kind of idol? The number of people in America on food stamps more than tripled in his second term. More than tripled! Average family income went down dramatically. Home ownership rates across America went down the toilet. Obama and his cronies sold us out. Real American workers have never had less of a share of the economy. The Equalizer actor also explained that while many of his Hollywood peers were groomed by the Obamas with invitations to parties in the White House black-tie balls and barbecues on the lawn he wasnt extended the same treatment. He knew I was very suspect about him. I have always been very suspect about him. Where did he come from? What was he really doing before running for office? His history sure isnt what they say. Did he go to Columbia? Who put him in power? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about Obama and his colleagues. Once upon a time this is what investigative journalists at the big newspapers would be determined to find out. Now you have all been co-opted. You defend the crooks.,,,0,0,,

Julia Roberts was speaking on the New York set of her new film as principal photography began on the drama Ben Is Back. Michelle Obama paid a visit to the film production while in the vicinity and Julia Roberts agreed to meet her however she opened up about the differences between Americas most recent First Ladies as soon as Michelle left the set. Melania has her priorities straight and she is a great example for our young women Julia Roberts said. Michelle? Talk about a wolf in sheepskin. The news comes days after Julia Roberts slammed Celine Dion for criticizing the POTUS and stating that she hates America. I cant even look at an American flag anymore. I hate this country Canadian Celine Dion said while complaining about the Trump presidency. Youre wrong Celine Julia Roberts fired back. The America we know and love was destroyed by Obama and his disastrous presidency. If you disagree you can always go back to your own country. In fact perhaps you really should. Celine Dion was one of dozens of liberal celebrities who threatened to leave the United States and return to their homelands if America elected Donald Trump as president. So far a grand total of zero of these liberal celebrities have followed through with their threat to leave. The sheer hypocrisy makes it hard to believe they really feel as strongly as they claim about Trump. Its all hot air and virtue signaling from the celebrity contingent on the left.

Soros who enjoys Hungarian citizenship says he doesnt care who knows that he buys Congressmen: When Charles Koch does it hes a patriot. When I do it Im a criminal. The three senators could be guilty of taking dark money if its determined that Soros cash came from overseas. At any rate the timing is criminal in and of itself.

Tom and Janis Morrison a young couple from the small town of Greensboro in Alabama called 911 around 10:00 pm last night to ask for an ambulance. Samantha Irving the operator who took the call says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation. The woman told me that her husband had fallen and that his head was now stuck in her vaginal cavity. I really thought that it was a group of teenagers making a prank call. Despite Ms. Irvings doubts she sent an ambulance on the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious. Bill Austin one of the paramedics who transported the couple claims they were lying naked on their bed and partially covered in blood. The woman kept screaming out in pain whenever the guy moved but he had half of his face buried in there and he looked like he was going through Hell! The couple was transported to the nearby Hale County Hospital where doctors were able to separate the couple. Ms. Morrison suffered from severe internal bleeding but is now stable while her husband has suffered only a few scratches and bruises. According to doctors both could also suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome. Dr. Frank Olson who treated the couple upon their arrival at the hospital says that such extreme sexual practices are extremely dangerous and recommends to completely avoid them. Incidents like this one are indeed quite unusual but hundreds of couples are admitted to the hospital every year in the U.S. after getting stuck together during sexual intercourse. According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 3213 couples were hospitalized for such problems across the country in 2015 and 3789 in 2016. According to the same data the Morrisons are the first couple to be hospitalized for a head stuck inside a vaginal cavity since October 2007.,,,0,0,,

773,http://newsbeatreporter.com/haiti-clinton-dead-1-b/,https://www.snopes.com/klaus-eberwein/,2017-07-17,1000.0,false,Bill and Hillary Clinton have ever exactly been above doing something horrible for personal gain or to protect themselves. They are as crooked as a football bat. Also it seems that everyone that comes into contact with them seems to always die under mysterious circumstances. Its no secret that the Clinton Foundation has been facing credible reports of robbing impoverished Haitians who were devastated by Hurricane Hanna in 2008 through their foundation. Haitians have been protesting for years outside of the Clinton Foundation offices over the theft of money that was donated by individuals and businesses to the Clinton Foundation that never made it to the poorest of the poor. One man was set to testify against the Clinton Foundation next week. That man was 50 year old former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein. He was found dead in his Miami home with a gunshot to the head thats been ruled a suicide by the Miami-Dades medical examiner records supervisor. (Think Vince Foster) Klaus Eberwein a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week has been found dead in Miami. He was 50. Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors. Eberwein who had acknowledged his life was in danger was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundations activities in the Caribbean island where he served as director general of the governments economic development agency Fonds dassistance conomique et social for three years. According to Eberwein a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% or $5.4 billion was funneled to non-Haitian organizations. The Clinton Foundation they are criminals they are thieves they are liars they are a disgrace Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year. The former director general of Haiti who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti Muncheez and even has a pizza the Klaus Special named after him. According to the Haiti Libre newspaper Eberwein was said to be in good spirits with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide. Its really shocking said Muncheezs owner Gilbert Bailly. We grew up together; he was like family. Americans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016 former Senate President of Haiti Bernard Sansaricq shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clintons dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind and to expose the crimes of the Clintons who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.

DeMille Award at the Golden Globes ceremony on 7 January 2018 prompting media speculationabout a future political career including a possible 2020 presidential bid. It also prompted the spread of derogatory rumors by her detractors. One such rumor centered on comments Winfrey made during a 2013 BBC interview in which she was asked whether or not she believes the problem of racism has been solved. Her alleged response? In order for the problem of racism to be solved old white people have to die. Heres an example of a tweet asserting that Winfrey said it: WINFREY: It would be foolish to not recognize that we have evolved and that were not still facing the same kind of terrorism against black people en masse as was displayed with the Scottsboro boys. Its gotten better.Are there still places where people are terrorized because of the color of their skin because of the color of their black skin? Yes. But there are laws that have allowed us to progress beyond what we saw in the Scottsboro Boys and beyond even prejudice that we see in The Butler. I mean his ability to go in One of my favorite scenes ever spoiler alert is him going in and asking for the raise. I think thats one of the finest acting jobs Ive ever seen. You know that moment? INTERVIEWER: Of course. Are you saying problem solved? WINFREY: Im saying problem not solved. Im saying that you know thats the beauty of a film like The Butler and its the beauty of a film like 12 Years a Slave and its the beauty of what were seeing on stage with Scottsboro Boys it allows people to see where the root of the problem started. It allows people to see Oh thats where it all started this is how far weve come and now this is how much farther we need to go. Of course the problem is not solved. As long as people can be judged by the color of their skin the problems not solved. As long as there are people who still And theres a whole generation I said this for apartheid South Africa I said this for my own community in the South there are still generations of people older people who were born and bred and marinated in it in that prejudice and racism and they just have to die. Its valid given the context to infer that the majority of the people Winfrey was talking about are white but invalid to infer that her remarks targeted all older white people or only older white people. In other words those accusing Winfrey of racism draw a false equivalence between generations marinated in racism and all older white people. However contentious and impolitic it may have been for Winfrey to claim that older generations steeped in prejudice will have to die before the problem of racism can be solved the objection that it was racist of her to say so is absurd.,,,0,0,,

This rumor began circulating as soon as Trump was elected President of the United States but these idiots continue to push the matter. Our message to them DO IT. We dont need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie ODonnell think that the movie and television industry wouldnt survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are. Mike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry. He mentioned the lower paid support staff who do all of the behind the scenes work. The people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets who make the costumes who create the props and in some cases do the stunts and the special effectsMike explained. And theyre not getting the bazillion dollar deals. Its about time that these jerkoffs realize that they arent the only people in this world. The fact remains that Donald Trump is our President whether they like it or not and that isnt about to change. Lets hope that for the sake of everyone else in Hollywood these ignorant celebrities suck it up and deal with the fact that their candidate didnt win. Maybe if they took their heads out of their asses long enough to even listen to Trumps goals for his time in office they would feel different Watch one news networks story on the matter: Sources: http://nativeamericanapache.com,,,0,0,,

With so many new things being created every day things of the past can be perceived as less relevant. But its for this same reason that names also have one valuable role. They allow us to preserve our legacy and heritage. Over the last few months we have heard how liberals have tried to desecrate the history of our ancestors by trying to remove Confederate monuments from our cities. Now they are going a step further and they are trying to remove the name Dixie from our history. Highway located in Riviera Beach Florida is officially being renamed as President Barack Obama Highway. The change was decided after city officials concluded the old name was racist and offensive. They believe that by changing it to Obama they will get a clean slate on history. (The street is) symbolic of racism symbolic of the clan symbolic of cross burnings and today we are stepping up to a new day a new era said the mayor of Riviera Beach. While it was indeed true that in the past there was some KKK activity in the Riviera Beach and the major may want to distance themselves from that. To believe that they can hold the name Dixie accountable for such history borders between insult and stupidity. There is nothing racist with either Dixie or Confederate monuments. They are part of the American history and are part of a rich culture that goes beyond whatever bad liberals may want to attach to it. To arbitrarily decide that President Obama may be more relevant to American History than hundreds of years of heritage is ludicrous. On top of that Obama has never done anything for equality in America. For those who believe he is a role model for Afro Americans. He was raised by outside the country and his black heritage comes from his Kenyan father who abandoned him. He was raised by a white couple and never understood any of the racial conflicts in this country. Obamas self-claim of representing African Americans while sharing no heritage or culture has probably been the most racist proclamation of modern politics. Its time that people stopped trying to use public stunts like this to foster unity. A real sense of unity can only come from sharing common goals and improving together throughout generations. Renaming a heritage street with the name of the worst president of American History is not proof of anything.,,,0,0,,

Jesus Ramon Sanchez from the Little Havana neighborhood in Miami was allegedly attempting to engage in sexual intercourse with a 4-year old male pit bull when the dog defended itself by tearing off the mans genitals with its teeth. The incident took place around 8:30 this morning in the Allen Morris Dog Park in Miami. According to witnesses 4-year old Spanky was playing with his owner in the park when Mister Sanchez grabbed him and attempted to rape him. The male pit bull violently resisted and severely injured its attackers legs arms and groin. According to its owner this is the first time that Spanky has ever bitten anyone and he acted strictly out of self-defense. The dog was just running around playing with a ball when the man came out of nowhere and tried to grab it says Dorothy Steinberg a witness of the events. The man had his pants down and was struggling with the dog. Everyone in the park was just stunned and nobody did anything but the dog defended itself and bit back. In a matter of seconds he grabbed the mans genitals with its teeth and literally tore them apart. And this is not the 1st case below its video from last October .,,,0,0,,

Akimbo Obwebwe a 29-year-old zoo intern originally from Gabon was found guilty of feeding sedatives to Big George one of the zoos top attractions and partaking in sexual activity with the sedated animal. According to unreleased video footage Obwebwe proceeded to insert the animals penis inside his mouth for several minutes but apparently underestimated the strength of the medication leading the animal to wake up and lash back at the zookeeper alerting other employees. Although Mr. Obwebwe claims the sexual relationship was consensual video footage clearly shows he attempted to sedate the animal Adam Simmons a San Diego zoo spokesman told reporters. His conduct was clearly inappropriate reckless and dangerous for the animal as well he explained. Any sexual activity between animals and employees is strictly prohibited by San Diego zoo policy he added. Unreleased video footage allegedly shows Big George one of San Diego zoos top attractions being sexually assaulted by Akimbo Obwebwe a 29-year-old zoo intern originally from Gabon. An act of despair San Diego zoo administrator Janette Fitzgerald says Mr. Obwebwe may have acted out of despair after learning his wife had left him. Some employees had voiced concerns that Mr. Obwebwe had recently become uneasily friendly with the animals since his divorce but I could not expect it was this bad she told reporters. I am not aware of Gabonese cultural practices but it might also be a cultural thing she added. According to current Californian law bestiality is classed as a misdemeanor an offense that is punishable by a maximum six-month county jail sentence and a maximum $1000 fine.,,,0,0,,

An explosive report by The Gateway Pundit reveals that there may be a reason for his support beyond Schumers purported love of Mexican criminals above our veterans and poor children. In fact there is a reason. $500000 of them in fact. Transparency website Glass Tabletop revealed Saturday that just before the Friday evening vote Schumer received three separate campaign donation from Immigration for Everyone the Council for Alien Rights and the Southern Border Defense Fund three groups that regularly push for complete amnesty for all illegals. Thanks to this donation and his hatred of President Trump Schumer was more than willing to encourage his fellow Democrats to vote against keeping the government open. 90% of them listened. Only five Democrats summoned enough patriotism to vote FOR America. 2018 is our chance to reaffirm that we want Donald Trumps America that we want freedom and democracy and rule of law.

Julia Roberts was speaking on the New York set of her new film as principal photography began on the drama Ben Is Back.

Michelle Obama paid a visit to the film production while in the vicinity and Julia Roberts agreed to meet her however she opened up about the differences between Americas most recent First Ladies as soon as Michelle left the set. Melania has her priorities straight and she is a great example for our young women Julia Roberts said. Michelle? Talk about a wolf in sheepskin. The news comes days after Julia Roberts slammed Celine Dion for criticizing the POTUS and stating that she hates America. I cant even look at an American flag anymore. I hate this country Canadian Celine Dion said while complaining about the Trump presidency. Youre wrong Celine Julia Roberts fired back. The America we know and love was destroyed by Obama and his disastrous presidency. If you disagree you can always go back to your own country. In fact perhaps you really should. Celine Dion was one of dozens of liberal celebrities who threatened to leave the United States and return to their homelands if America elected Donald Trump as president. So far a grand total of zero of these liberal celebrities have followed through with their threat to leave. The sheer hypocrisy makes it hard to believe they really feel as strongly as they claim about Trump. Its all hot air and virtue signaling from the celebrity contingent on the left.

Revealing that a DNA test kit given to her by Gwyneth Paltrows 13-year-old daughter Apple Martin opened up a whole new world to me and created my obsession with tracing my family tree Beyonce told close friends and associates on Jay-Zs Family Feud video shoot that her family is closely related to the Bush family Rockefeller dynasty and the Queen of England. We are related to the Rockefellers on my Moms side. I thought that was something but we are also not-so-distant cousins of the British Royal Family Beyonce boasted. One of the most powerful families in the world the Rockefellers have extreme wealth and power. Beyond their holdings in real estate and industry as well as their political connections the Rockefellers have given large amounts of money to religious organizations which are alleged by Illuminati watchers to actually be training grounds for Satanists. The Rockefellers were also instrumental in forming key Illuminati front groups like the Council on Foreign Relations. The Formation singer who has a personal fortune of $500 million also claimed to be related to the Bush family through ties on her fathers side of the family tree. We got Bush blood running through our veins. Shame it isnt Obama blood. But its presidential blood twice over Beyonce boasted. WHO ARE THE ILLUMINATI? The Illuminati is the name given to an elite secretive organization of world leaders business owners and other powerful members of this planet. Their plan is to control humanity and the planets limited resources by consolidating the worlds finances natural resources military and media into entities they control. 13 illuminati bloodlines sit on top of the power pyramid secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes. The Council of the 13 families orchestrates all of the major world events. As the name suggests the Council consists of the top 13 most influential families on Earth. The Illuminati have a set of goals in order to fulfil their masterplan. As of 2018 many of the goals have been fulfilled with the rest of them looming on the horizon: 1. To establish a One World Government/New World Order with a unified church and monetary system under their direction. The One World Government began to set up its church in the 1920s and 30s for they realized the need for a religious belief inherent in mankind must have an outlet and therefore set up a church body to channel that belief in the direction they desired. 2. To bring about the utter destruction of all national identity and national pride which was a primary consideration if the concept of a One World Government was to work. 3. To engineer and bring about the destruction of religion and more especially the Christian Religion with the one exception their own creation as mentioned above. 4. To establish the ability to control of each and every person through means of mind control and what Zbignew Brzezinski called techonotronics which would create human-like robots and a system of terror which would make Felix Dzerzinhskis Red Terror look like children at play. 5. To bring about the end to all industrialization and to end the production of nuclear generated electric power in what they call the post-industrial zero-growth society. Excepted are the computer- and service industries. US industries that remain will be exported to countries such as Mexico where abundant slave labor is available. As we saw in 1993 this has become a fact through the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement known as NAFTA. Unemployables in the US in the wake of industrial destruction will either become opium-heroin and/or cocaine addicts or become statistics in the elimination of the excess population process we know of today as Global 2000. 6. To encourage and eventually legalize the use of drugs and make pornography an art-form which will be widely accepted and eventually become quite commonplace. 7. To bring about depopulation of large cities according to the trial run carried out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. It is interesting to note that Pol Pots genocidal plans were drawn up in the US by one of the Club of Romes research foundations and overseen by Thomas Enders a high-ranking State Department official. It is also interesting that the committee is currently seeking to reinstate the Pol Pot butchers in Cambodia. 8. To suppress all scientific development except for those deemed beneficial by the Illuminati. Especially targeted is nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Particularly hated are the fusion experiments currently being scorned and ridiculed by the Illuminati and its jackals of the press. Development of the fusion torch would blow the Illuminatis conception of limited natural resources right out of the window. A fusion torch properly used could create unlimited and as yet untapped natural resources even from the most ordinary substances. Fusion torch uses are legion and would benefit mankind in a manner which as yet is not even remotely comprehended by the public. 9. To cause by means of A) limited wars in the advanced countries B) by means of starvation and diseases in the Third World countries the death of three billion people by the year 2050 people they call useless eaters. The Committee of 300 (Illuminati) commissioned Cyrus Vance to write a paper on this subject of how to bring about such genocide. The paper was produced under the title Global 2000 Report and was accepted and approved for action by former President James Earl Carter and Edwin Muskie then Secretary of States for and on behalf of the US Government. Under the terms of the Global 2000 Report the population of the US is to be reduced by 100 million by the year of 2050. 10. To weaken the moral fiber of the nation and to demoralize workers in the labor class by creating mass unemployment. As jobs dwindle due to the post industrial zero growth policies introduced by the Club of Rome the report envisages demoralized and discouraged workers resorting to alcohol and drugs. The youth of the land will be encouraged by means of rock music and drugs to rebel against the status quo thus undermining and eventually destroying the family unit. In this regard the Committee commissioned Tavistock Institute to prepare a blueprint as to how this could be achieved. Tavistock directed Stanford Research to undertake the work under the direction of Professor Willis Harmon. This work later became known as the Aquarian Conspiracy. 11. To keep people everywhere from deciding their own destinies by means of one created crisis after another and then managing such crises. This will confuse and demoralize the population to the extent where faced with too many choices apathy on a massive scale will result. In the case of the US an agency for Crisis Management is already in place. It is called the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) whose existence I first enclosed in 1980. 12. To introduce new cults and continue to boost those already functioning which include rock music gangsters such as the Rolling Stones (a gangster group much favored by European Black Nobility) and all of the Tavistock-created rock groups which began with the Beatles. 13. To continue to build up the cult of Christian Fundamentalism begun by the British East India Companys servant Darby which will be misused to strengthen the Zionist State of Israel by identifying with the Jews through the myth of Gods chosen people and by donating very substantial amounts of money to what they mistakenly believe is a religious cause in the furtherance of Christianity. 14. To press for the spread of religious cults such as the Moslem Brotherhood Moslem Fundamentalism the Sikhs and to carry out mind control experiments of the Jim Jones and Son of Sam type. It is worth noting that the late Khomeini was a creation of British Military Intelligence Div. 6 MI6. This detailed work spelled out the step-by-step process which the US Government implemented to put Khomeini in power. 15. To export religious liberation ideas around the world so as to undermine all existing religions but more especially the Christian religion. This began with the Jesuit Liberation Theology that brought an end to the Somoza Family rule in Nicaragua and which today is destroying El Salvador now 25 years into a civil war. Costa Rica and Honduras are also embroiled in revolutionary activities instigated by the Jesuits. One very active entity engaged in the so-called liberation theology is the Communist-oriented Mary Knoll Mission. This accounts for the extensive media attention to the murder of four of Mary Knolls so-called nuns in El Salvador a few years ago. The four nuns were Communist subversive agents and their activities were widely documented by the Government of El Salvador. The US press and the new media refused to give any space or coverage to the mass of documentation possessed by the Salvadorian Government which proved what the Mary Knoll Mission nuns were doing in the country. Mary Knoll is in service in many countries and placed a leading role in bringing Communism to Rhodesia Moambique Angola and South Africa. 16. To cause a total collapse of the worlds economies and engender total political chaos. 17. To take control of all foreign and domestic policies of the US. 18. To give the fullest support to supranational institutions such as the United Nations the International Monetary Fund (IMF) the Bank of International Settlements the World Court and as far as possible make local institutions less effective by gradually phasing them out or bringing them under the mantle of the UN. 19. To penetrate and subvert all governments and work from within them to destroy the sovereign integrity of the nations represented by them. 20. To organize a world-wide terrorist apparatus [Al-Qaeda ISIS ISIL etc.] and to negotiate with terrorists whenever terrorist activities take place. It will be recalled that it was Bettino Craxi who persuaded the Italian and US Governments to negotiate with the Red Brigades kidnapers of Prime Minister Moro and General Dozier. As an aside Dozier was placed under strict orders not to talk what happened to him. Should he ever break that silence he will no doubt be made a horrible example of in the manner in which Henry Kissinger dealt with Aldo Moro Ali Bhutto and General Zia ul Haq. 21. To take control of education in America with the intent and purpose of utterly and completely destroying it.,,,0,0,,

In an interview on Wednesday Prince Harry then dropped a truth bomb live on air. Although Prince Harry has fostered a friendship with the 44th president as the pair share many of the same liberal views the Queen has banned her grandson from inviting Obama to his wedding which is set to take place in March of next year because it could offend President Donald Trump. Trump has not yet met Queen Elizabeth and British relations with his administration have hit a low point so it would be seen as a major snub to invite Obama. Clearly the Queen does not want to anger the most powerful leader in the world just so that Harry can add a bit of progressive star power to his weddings guest list. And then theres the fact that Harrys betrothed is an avid Trump-hater. Markel was even among the celebrities who vowed to move to Canada if Trump were to be elected. As part of his role as guest editor for BBC Radio Prince Harry interviewed Obama in September at the Invictus Games in Toronto Canada. Their talk was released today on the heels of the news that Obama would not be getting a coveted invite to the royal wedding. Prince Harrys role as guest editor for BBC News is getting a lot of play today because of his most recent guest: former President Barack Obama in his first post-presidential interview. The interview which has been a big story on the cable and broadcast networks today aired this morning on BBC Radio but was actually recorded in Toronto in September during the Invictus Games. The Prince asked the president for his thoughts on the day he left office as well as his post-presidential work with the Obama Foundation. [Source: Adweek] BBC News then interviewed Harry regarding his interview with Obama. Naturally the Prince was asked whether the former president would be invited to his wedding and he attempted to avoid controversy by saying that he does not know who will or will not be invited to his own wedding. We havent put the guest list together yet so who knows whether hes going to be invited or not. Wouldnt want to ruin that surprise said Harry. Britains Prince Harry has avoided opening up a diplomatic rift between the British and US governments over the guest list for his wedding to Meghan Markle saying plans had yet to be finalized. Asked on a BBC radio program whether he would invite former US President Barack ObamaHarry swerved the question saying he didnt want to ruin that surprise. There has been speculation in the UK media that British officials fear the political consequences if the couple decide to invite Barack and Michelle Obama with whom they are friends but not President Donald Trump. Markle an American actor has been critical of Trump in the past and there is already widespread controversy in the UK over the prospect of an official visit by the President to the UK. [Source: CNN] In reality Harry and Meghan will have very little say when it comes to who they can invite to their own wedding. These matters are choreographed down to the smallest detail by British officials. Markel may fancy herself an activist but shell have to start pulling the reins on that little side gig and learn to keep her big mouth shut. Royals are not permitted to make political statements or push a certain agenda. This will be one of the many things Markel will be forced to give up if she wants to ride the gravy train as a member of the royal family for the rest of her life. Like this: Like Loading...,,,0,0,,

Some of the patients Ive administered the flu shot to this year have died the doctor said adding I dont care who you are this scares the crap out of me. We have seen people dying across the country of the flu and one thing nearly all of them have in common is they got the flu shot. Scientists were worried this years flu season was going to be rough and their fears have been proven well founded. The flu season is off to a record-breaking start with the CDC reporting widespread flu activity from coast to coast. Many health officials believe that 2018 will ultimately be the worst flu outbreak that we have experienced since 1918. The CDC doctors experience of patients dying of the flu after receiving the flu shot is sadly not uncommon. Eight Santa Barbara County residents have died from the flu in the last fortnight. Seven of them had the flu shot. This deadly pattern is replicating itself across the country. Yet health officials are still telling people to get the flu shot even though it does not work well this season. Officials have started admitting that the vaccine it is only 10% effective. The verdict is out on flu shots. Many medical experts now agree it is more important to protect yourself and your family from the flu vaccine than the flu itself. Macedonia: Watch This Video About Bitcoin Before It Gets Banned & Deleted The Bitcoin Code Ads by Revcontent Find Out More > 20545 Every year the pharmaceutical industry medical experts and the mainstream media work hard to convince us to get vaccinated against the flu. 2018 is no different. But as usual were not being told the whole story. Pharmaceutical companies provide mainstream media outlets with a huge percentage of their advertising revenue. Big pharmaceutical companies actually spend far more on advertising than research. We are talking hundreds of billions of dollars. Big Pharmas dollars have effectively purchased the silence of mainstream media. You can no longer believe anything they say about pharmaceuticals especially vaccines. It is clear Big Pharma is desperate to ensure mainstream media outlets never tell us about adverse reactions or the toxic chemicals being injected into us in the flu shot. Flu vaccines contain dangerous ingredients The pharmaceutical industry medical experts and the mainstream media admit to us that flu vaccines contain strains of the flu virus. What they are less likely to reveal though is the long list of other ingredients that come with the vaccine. It is now a known fact that flu vaccines contain mercury a heavy metal known to be hazardous for human health. Mercury toxicity can cause depression memory loss cardiovascular diseases respiratory problems ADD oral health problems digestive imbalances and other serious health issues. The flu vaccines actually do not immunize but sensitize the body against the virus Have you ever noticed how vaccinated children get sick almost immediately following a vaccination? This is because the flu virus is introduced into their bodies. So rather than immunize the flu shot actually only sensitizes the body against the virus. And the fact that it causes individuals to get ill following a shot indicates immuno-suppression (i.e. lowering of the immunity). Makes you more susceptible to pneumonia and other contagious diseases For someone with an already suppressed immune system injecting strains of the flu virus can have devastating consequences. If your body is already working to fight off a virus or simply operating with low immunity a vaccine injection could put your body in serious danger of contracting influenza with stronger symptoms or even worse pneumonia and other contagious diseases. Weakens immunological responses There have been literally thousands of medical journal articles published that show injecting vaccines can lead to harmful immunological responses and a host of other infections. Moreover weak immunological responses only decrease a persons ability to fight the diseases that the vaccine was supposed to protect against in the first place. Serious neurological disorders Evidence now suggests that ingredients in flu vaccinations can actually cause serious neurological disorders. In 1976 a significant number of those who received the flu vaccine acquired Guillain-Barr Syndrome (GBS) a disorder characterized by permanent nerve damage and even paralysis. Flu vaccines can contain many harmful materials including detergent mercury formaldehyde and strains of live flu virus. Should you get a flu shot? If you are still prevaricating and wondering who to trust consider this: The very people pushing flu vaccinations and putting the fear of God into anybody who abstains are making billions of dollars each year. Are they the people we should be trusting with our health? In August 1999 the Committee on Government Reform initiated an investigation into Federal vaccine policy. This investigation focused on possible conflicts of interest on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The investigation concluded that many individuals serving on two key advisory committees had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines. Often these individuals were granted waivers to fully participate in the discussions that led to recommendations on vaccine licensing and adding vaccines to the Childhood Immunization Schedule. This in itself creates serious doubt as to how effective flu vaccines really are.,,,0,0,,

This rumor began circulating as soon as Trump was elected President of the United States but these idiots continue to push the matter. Our message to them DO IT. We dont need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie ODonnell think that the movie and television industry wouldnt survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are. Mike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry. He mentioned the lower paid support staff who do all of the behind the scenes work. The people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets who make the costumes who create the props and in some cases do the stunts and the special effects Mike explained.

Federal debt skyrocketed under Obama. He was printing money by the end of his reign. This is unheard of in our history. He ran the country like a banana republic said Denzel Washington at a New York screening of his new film the legal drama Roman J. Israel Esq. Asked by a reporter whether his information about Obama was correct Denzel Washington confirmed that it was absolutely correct. He also criticized mainstream media for attempting to turn Obama into a kind of idol. Why arent CNN discussing the facts? They think we are too stupid to understand the metrics? Denzel Washington said explaining that he had seen a CNN segment about Obamas legacy that blew my mind and left me raging. There were more ready-and-willing workers out of the labor force than ever before by the time that guy left office. Obama blew it for America big time and now they are trying to portray him as some kind of idol? The number of people in America on food stamps more than tripled in his second term. More than tripled! Average family income went down dramatically. Home ownership rates across America went down the toilet. Obama and his cronies sold us out. Real American workers have never had less of a share of the economy. The Equalizer actor also explained that while many of his Hollywood peers were groomed by the Obamas with invitations to parties in the White House black-tie balls and barbecues on the lawn he wasnt extended the same treatment. He knew I was very suspect about him. I have always been very suspect about him. Where did he come from? What was he really doing before running for office? His history sure isnt what they say. Did he go to Columbia? Who put him in power? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about Obama and his colleagues. Once upon a time this is what investigative journalists at the big newspapers would be determined to find out. Now you have all been co-opted. You defend the crooks.,,,0,0,,
803,http://usdailyinsider.com/trump-hater-meghan-markle-tries-invite-obamas-royal-wedding-queen-sets-straight/,https://www.snopes.com/queen-elizabeth-remove-obamas-guest-list/,2017-12-06,3000.0,false,Prince Harry seemingly just popped the question to American actress Meghan Markle and already their engagement has been plagued by scandal. Now it seems that Meghan a known Trump-hater has tried to invite Barack and Michelle Obama to her royal wedding. Unfortunately for her the Queen was quick to set her straight. Prince Harry fostered a friendship with Former President Barack Obama during the Invictus Games and Michelle Obama even used her official social media channels to promote the Princes project. Prince Harry has also interviewed Barack Obama for BBC Radio 4s Today show. In another sign of their friendship Obama tweeted his congratulations to Harry and Meghan when the pair announced their engagement last month saying he and the former first lady were delighted. He added We wish you a lifetime of joy and happiness together. Now Harry and Meghan want to invite the Obamas to attend their wedding celebration. However the Queen has put the kibosh on that idea seeing as it would be sure to offend President Donald Trump who will not be invited. Britains relationship with the Trump administration has sunk to its lowest point since the presidential election last year and the fact that Prince Harry has chosen to marry an ardent Trump-hater hasnt helped matters. In fact Meghan was one of the many misguided celebrities who threatened to move to Canada if Trump won. Markle who stars in the show Suits appeared on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore in May 2016. While she was on the show she was asked how Trump could be stopped. Its really the moment that I go we film Suits in Toronto and I might just stay in Canada she said. I mean come on if thats reality we are talking about come on that is a game changer in terms of how we move in the world here. Considering this its no wonder the Queen is remiss to allow Meghan and Harry to include the Obamas on their guest list. One more snub and Trump just might cut off the UK completely like he did with the UN. Harry has made it clear he wants the Obamas at the wedding so its causing a lot of nervousness said a senior source within the British government. Trump could react very badly if the Obamas get to a Royal wedding before he has had a chance to meet the Queen the source continued. Conversations are ongoing about (it) and ministers will eventually have to decide. If the PM lays down the law Harry will just have to suck it up added the source. As the wedding is not a state occasion the Government only have a consultative role in its organization and heads of state will not be invited. The guest list is instead being drawn up in full by Buckingham Palace rather than the Department of Culture Media and Sport which presides over national events such as state funerals. Meghan Markle is proving to be a major PR nightmare for the royal family and she just got engaged. This girl is going to need to learn to keep her big liberal mouth shut if she wants to ride the gravy train as a member of the royal family for the rest of her life.

805,http://ustoday.website/post/707,https://www.snopes.com/trump-obama-highway-name-change/,2018-01-04,646.0,false,Sometimes most of us rush to disregard the importance of names. With so many new things being created every day things of the past can be perceived as less relevant. But its for this same reason that names also have one valuable role. They allow us to preserve our legacy and heritage. Over the last few months we have heard how liberals have tried to desecrate the history of our ancestors by trying to remove Confederate monuments from our cities. Now they are going a step further and they are trying to remove the name Dixie from our history. Highway located in Riviera Beach Florida is officially being renamed as President Barack Obama Highway. The change was decided after city officials concluded the old name was racist and offensive. They believe that by changing it to Obama they will get a clean slate on history. (The street is) symbolic of racism symbolic of the clan symbolic of cross burnings and today we are stepping up to a new day a new era said the mayor of Riviera Beach. While it was indeed true that in the past there was some KKK activity in the Riviera Beach and the major may want to distance themselves from that. To believe that they can hold the name Dixie accountable for such history borders between insult and stupidity. There is nothing racist with either Dixie or Confederate monuments. They are part of the American history and are part of a rich culture that goes beyond whatever bad liberals may want to attach to it. To arbitrarily decide that President Obama may be more relevant to American History than hundreds of years of heritage is ludicrous. On top of that Obama has never done anything for equality in America. For those who believe he is a role model for Afro Americans. He was raised by outside the country and his black heritage comes from his Kenyan father who abandoned him. He was raised by a white couple and never understood any of the racial conflicts in this country. Obamas self-claim of representing African Americans while sharing no heritage or culture has probably been the most racist proclamation of modern politics. Its time that people stopped trying to use public stunts like this to foster unity. A real sense of unity can only come from sharing common goals and improving together throughout generations. Renaming a heritage street with the name of the worst president of American History is not proof of anything.,,,0,0,,

Their plan is to control humanity and the planets limited resources by consolidating the worlds finances natural resources military and media into entities they control. 13 illuminati bloodlines sit on top of the power pyramid secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes. The Council of the 13 families orchestrates all of the major world events. As the name suggests the Council consists of the top 13 most influential families on Earth. The Illuminati have a set of goals in order to fulfil their masterplan. As of 2018 many of the goals have been fulfilled with the rest of them looming on the horizon: 1. To establish a One World Government/New World Order with a unified church and monetary system under their direction. The One World Government began to set up its church in the 1920s and 30s for they realized the need for a religious belief inherent in mankind must have an outlet and therefore set up a church body to channel that belief in the direction they desired. 2. To bring about the utter destruction of all national identity and national pride which was a primary consideration if the concept of a One World Government was to work. 3. To engineer and bring about the destruction of religion and more especially the Christian Religion with the one exception their own creation as mentioned above. 4. To establish the ability to control of each and every person through means of mind control and what Zbignew Brzezinski called techonotronics which would create human-like robots and a system of terror which would make Felix Dzerzinhskis Red Terror look like children at play. 5. To bring about the end to all industrialization and to end the production of nuclear generated electric power in what they call the post-industrial zero-growth society. Excepted are the computer- and service industries. US industries that remain will be exported to countries such as Mexico where abundant slave labor is available. As we saw in 1993 this has become a fact through the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement known as NAFTA. Unemployables in the US in the wake of industrial destruction will either become opium-heroin and/or cocaine addicts or become statistics in the elimination of the excess population process we know of today as Global 2000. 6. To encourage and eventually legalize the use of drugs and make pornography an art-form which will be widely accepted and eventually become quite commonplace. 7. To bring about depopulation of large cities according to the trial run carried out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. It is interesting to note that Pol Pots genocidal plans were drawn up in the US by one of the Club of Romes research foundations and overseen by Thomas Enders a high-ranking State Department official. It is also interesting that the committee is currently seeking to reinstate the Pol Pot butchers in Cambodia. 8. To suppress all scientific development except for those deemed beneficial by the Illuminati. Especially targeted is nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Particularly hated are the fusion experiments currently being scorned and ridiculed by the Illuminati and its jackals of the press. Development of the fusion torch would blow the Illuminatis conception of limited natural resources right out of the window. A fusion torch properly used could create unlimited and as yet untapped natural resources even from the most ordinary substances. Fusion torch uses are legion and would benefit mankind in a manner which as yet is not even remotely comprehended by the public. 9. To cause by means of A) limited wars in the advanced countries B) by means of starvation and diseases in the Third World countries the death of three billion people by the year 2050 people they call useless eaters. The Committee of 300 (Illuminati) commissioned Cyrus Vance to write a paper on this subject of how to bring about such genocide. The paper was produced under the title Global 2000 Report and was accepted and approved for action by former President James Earl Carter and Edwin Muskie then Secretary of States for and on behalf of the US Government. Under the terms of the Global 2000 Report the population of the US is to be reduced by 100 million by the year of 2050. 10. To weaken the moral fiber of the nation and to demoralize workers in the labor class by creating mass unemployment. As jobs dwindle due to the post industrial zero growth policies introduced by the Club of Rome the report envisages demoralized and discouraged workers resorting to alcohol and drugs. The youth of the land will be encouraged by means of rock music and drugs to rebel against the status quo thus undermining and eventually destroying the family unit. In this regard the Committee commissioned Tavistock Institute to prepare a blueprint as to how this could be achieved. Tavistock directed Stanford Research to undertake the work under the direction of Professor Willis Harmon. This work later became known as the Aquarian Conspiracy. 11. To keep people everywhere from deciding their own destinies by means of one created crisis after another and then managing such crises. This will confuse and demoralize the population to the extent where faced with too many choices apathy on a massive scale will result. In the case of the US an agency for Crisis Management is already in place. It is called the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) whose existence I first enclosed in 1980. 12. To introduce new cults and continue to boost those already functioning which include rock music gangsters such as the Rolling Stones (a gangster group much favored by European Black Nobility) and all of the Tavistock-created rock groups which began with the Beatles. 13. To continue to build up the cult of Christian Fundamentalism begun by the British East India Companys servant Darby which will be misused to strengthen the Zionist State of Israel by identifying with the Jews through the myth of Gods chosen people and by donating very substantial amounts of money to what they mistakenly believe is a religious cause in the furtherance of Christianity. 14. To press for the spread of religious cults such as the Moslem Brotherhood Moslem Fundamentalism the Sikhs and to carry out mind control experiments of the Jim Jones and Son of Sam type. It is worth noting that the late Khomeini was a creation of British Military Intelligence Div. 6 MI6. This detailed work spelled out the step-by-step process which the US Government implemented to put Khomeini in power. 15. To export religious liberation ideas around the world so as to undermine all existing religions but more especially the Christian religion. This began with the Jesuit Liberation Theology that brought an end to the Somoza Family rule in Nicaragua and which today is destroying El Salvador now 25 years into a civil war. Costa Rica and Honduras are also embroiled in revolutionary activities instigated by the Jesuits. One very active entity engaged in the so-called liberation theology is the Communist-oriented Mary Knoll Mission. This accounts for the extensive media attention to the murder of four of Mary Knolls so-called nuns in El Salvador a few years ago. The four nuns were Communist subversive agents and their activities were widely documented by the Government of El Salvador. The US press and the new media refused to give any space or coverage to the mass of documentation possessed by the Salvadorian Government which proved what the Mary Knoll Mission nuns were doing in the country. Mary Knoll is in service in many countries and placed a leading role in bringing Communism to Rhodesia Moambique Angola and South Africa. 16. To cause a total collapse of the worlds economies and engender total political chaos. 17. To take control of all foreign and domestic policies of the US. 18. To give the fullest support to supranational institutions such as the United Nations the International Monetary Fund (IMF) the Bank of International Settlements the World Court and as far as possible make local institutions less effective by gradually phasing them out or bringing them under the mantle of the UN. 19. To penetrate and subvert all governments and work from within them to destroy the sovereign integrity of the nations represented by them. 20. To organize a world-wide terrorist apparatus [Al-Qaeda ISIS ISIL etc.] and to negotiate with terrorists whenever terrorist activities take place. It will be recalled that it was Bettino Craxi who persuaded the Italian and US Governments to negotiate with the Red Brigades kidnapers of Prime Minister Moro and General Dozier. As an aside Dozier was placed under strict orders not to talk what happened to him. Should he ever break that silence he will no doubt be made a horrible example of in the manner in which Henry Kissinger dealt with Aldo Moro Ali Bhutto and General Zia ul Haq. 21. To take control of education in America with the intent and purpose of utterly and completely destroying it.,,,0,0,,

People who say theyll try anything once are usually full of shit. How do I know this? Because if they tried praying to Satan just once theyd be doing it every day. Multiple times per day. Its really that powerful. Its a real trip. Speaking at a Stella McCartney fashion event in Los Angeles on Tuesday Katy Perry denied rumors that she has undergone plastic surgery and instead attributed her refreshed look to a new spiritual outlook. Advising everybody to add praying to Satan to your bucket list Katy Perry compared her first time praying to Satan to a mythical movie When Beckie Met Chad. My first time was like When Beckie Met Chad she said laughing at herself. People who are used to praying to God praying to Jesus or whatever well praying to Satan tends to rock the foundations of your world and changes your perceptions of who you thought you were. Its a whole extra level of amazing. People often say they feel like theyve opened a door and a real power has washed through them its like physical. Its like opening your front door in a hurricane. Life is short huh? said the host. Ive heard the rumors she said. Everybodys talking about it. Oh and the younger you start the better. The brain refuses to adapt to new stimuli after a certain age. Its like that with music too. The areas of the brain that deal with music and spirituality are closely linked. Katy Perrys Satanic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the devil. The daughter of two pastors Katy Perry started her career as a country singer before reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts. Since establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer the singer has attempted to tame her dark image however the disturbing conversation she held with the radio hosts suggests she is far from a reformed character and she has openly sold her soul to Satan. The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan and have begun using celebrities to openly promote Satanism as a viable religious choice for young people seeking spiritual guidance. Perry made public overtures to the Illuminati in 2014 flaunting herself and begging to join the secret society. Listen she said to Rolling Stone if the Illuminati exist I would like to be invited! I see all that shit and Im like Come on let me in! I want to be in the club! Fast forward four years and Katy Perry is basically demonic play dough. She has been at the forefront of the elites agenda for years now and has completed the transaction of her soul to the industry.,,,0,0,,

Nobody exactly knew the mans identity but friends and people that frequent the area referred to him as Jessie. Investigators preformed a DNA test in the nationwide DNA database and the results have shocked the nation. Jessie Does DNA results matched that of Elvis Aaron Presley who was thought to have died in 1977. Lab technician Robert Brensdale said he and his lab assistant Madeline Hedgespeth laughed when the name popped up. We thought somebody somewhere somehow in the system pulled the greatest and most elaborate prank on us ever we both laughed with hysteria for about an hour Bresndale told Jerry Hardin of the Hollywood Word a new entertainment publication based out of Los Angeles. Brensdale and Hedgespeth then went to their superior with laughter as if he were the one behind this prank. They were told to simmer down and stay quiet that this was no laughing matter. From there the results went up the ladder to the FBI and CIA. Now weeks later FBI spokesperson Philip Hunter has revealed that the deceased mans body was actually the body of Elvis Presley who had been in the witness protection program since 1977. The FBI has released this statement: Mr. Presley was placed in the program under a voluntary basis but he was not a witness to any crime. Upon meeting President Nixon the two became great friends and Mr. Presley wanted out of his life he wanted to be an unknown so President Nixon made this possible. Yes it is official Elvis Presley was really alive all that time and only a handful of people knew it most of which are no longer with us. His body will officially be laid to rest at his original burial site in the Meditation Garden at Graceland mansion at 3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard in Memphis Tennessee. The date has not yet been announced.

The same people who told Republicans to stop whining when Obama was in office prove themselves to be the absolute whiniest group of people to walk the earth. Many of Hollywoods elite are threatening to go on strike in protest of our President. This rumor began circulating as soon as Trump was elected President of the United States but these idiots continue to push the matter. Our message to them: DO IT. We dont need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie ODonnell think that the movie and television industry wouldnt survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are. Mike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry. He mentioned the lower paid support staff who do all of the behind the scenes work. The people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets who make the costumes who create the props and in some cases do the stunts and the special effects Mike explained. And theyre not getting the bazillion dollar deals. Its about time that these jerkoffs realize that they arent the only people in this world. The fact remains that Donald Trump is our President whether they like it or not and that isnt about to change. Lets hope that for the sake of everyone else in Hollywood these ignorant celebrities suck it up and deal with the fact that their candidate didnt win. Maybe if they took their heads out of their asses long enough to even listen to Trumps goals for his time in office they would feel differently.,,,0,0,,

We are related to the Rockefellers on my Moms side. I thought that was something but we are also not-so-distant cousins of the British Royal Family Beyonce boasted. One of the most powerful families in the world the Rockefellers have extreme wealth and power. Beyond their holdings in real estate and industry as well as their political connections the Rockefellers have given large amounts of money to religious organizations which are alleged by Illuminati watchers to actually be training grounds for Satanists. The Rockefellers were also instrumental in forming key Illuminati front groups like the Council on Foreign Relations. The Formation singer who has a personal fortune of $500 million also claimed to be related to the Bush family through ties on her fathers side of the family tree.

In the case of the US an agency for Crisis Management is already in place. It is called the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) whose existence I first enclosed in 1980. 12. To introduce new cults and continue to boost those already functioning which include rock music gangsters such as the Rolling Stones (a gangster group much favored by European Black Nobility) and all of the Tavistock-created rock groups which began with the Beatles. 13. To continue to build up the cult of Christian Fundamentalism begun by the British East India Companys servant Darby which will be misused to strengthen the Zionist State of Israel by identifying with the Jews through the myth of Gods chosen people and by donating very substantial amounts of money to what they mistakenly believe is a religious cause in the furtherance of Christianity. 14. To press for the spread of religious cults such as the Moslem Brotherhood Moslem Fundamentalism the Sikhs and to carry out mind control experiments of the Jim Jones and Son of Sam type. It is worth noting that the late Khomeini was a creation of British Military Intelligence Div. 6 MI6. This detailed work spelled out the step-by-step process which the US Government implemented to put Khomeini in power. 15. To export religious liberation ideas around the world so as to undermine all existing religions but more especially the Christian religion. This began with the Jesuit Liberation Theology that brought an end to the Somoza Family rule in Nicaragua and which today is destroying El Salvador now 25 years into a civil war. Costa Rica and Honduras are also embroiled in revolutionary activities instigated by the Jesuits. One very active entity engaged in the so-called liberation theology is the Communist-oriented Mary Knoll Mission. This accounts for the extensive media attention to the murder of four of Mary Knolls so-called nuns in El Salvador a few years ago. The four nuns were Communist subversive agents and their activities were widely documented by the Government of El Salvador. The US press and the new media refused to give any space or coverage to the mass of documentation possessed by the Salvadorian Government which proved what the Mary Knoll Mission nuns were doing in the country. Mary Knoll is in service in many countries and placed a leading role in bringing Communism to Rhodesia Moambique Angola and South Africa. 16. To cause a total collapse of the worlds economies and engender total political chaos. 17. To take control of all foreign and domestic policies of the US. 18. To give the fullest support to supranational institutions such as the United Nations the International Monetary Fund (IMF) the Bank of International Settlements the World Court and as far as possible make local institutions less effective by gradually phasing them out or bringing them under the mantle of the UN. 19. To penetrate and subvert all governments and work from within them to destroy the sovereign integrity of the nations represented by them. 20. To organize a world-wide terrorist apparatus [Al-Qaeda ISIS ISIL etc.] and to negotiate with terrorists whenever terrorist activities take place. It will be recalled that it was Bettino Craxi who persuaded the Italian and US Governments to negotiate with the Red Brigades kidnapers of Prime Minister Moro and General Dozier. As an aside Dozier was placed under strict orders not to talk what happened to him. Should he ever break that silence he will no doubt be made a horrible example of in the manner in which Henry Kissinger dealt with Aldo Moro Ali Bhutto and General Zia ul Haq. 21. To take control of education in America with the intent and purpose of utterly and completely destroying it. Source: yournewswire.com,,,0,0,,

Unfortunately we cannot answer your call today because Congressional Democrats are holding government fundingincluding funding for our troops and other national security prioritieshostage to an unrelated immigration debate the recording says. The message which was recorded for the White Houses public comment line said calls could not be answered because of the obstruction from Democrats. Due to this obstruction the government is shut down the recording continued. The message ended by informing callers that they can leave comments for President Trump on the White House website contact page until the government reopens. During a government shutdown all non-essential services including the National Park Service and museums cease to operate. Essential operations such as the military the post office and federally-run medical centers remain openalthough many employees will not receive immediate payment while the government is closed. The government shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday after Senate Democrats refused to fund the government if a deal on DACA amnesty was not negotiated. The White House responded that there would be no amnesty negotiations in the government funding package. The Senate is in session as of Sunday as lawmakers work to reopen the government.,,"7s02r7,7s04u4,7s02wz,7s02f1,",18,1,"The_Donald,NewsWhatever,TheNewsFeed,Right_Wing_Politics,","dirtyharrison,dirtyharrison,thefeedbot,ultimaregem,"

Many of Hollywoods elite are threatening to go on strike in protest of our President. This rumor began circulating as soon as Trump was elected President of the United States but these idiots continue to push the matter. Our message to them DO IT. We dont need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie ODonnell think that the movie and television industry wouldnt survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are. Watch one news networks story on the matter: Mike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry. He mentioned the lower paid support staff who do all of the behind the scenes work. The people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets who make the costumes who create the props and in some cases do the stunts and the special effectsMike explained. And theyre not getting the bazillion dollar deals. Its about time that these jerkoffs realize that they arent the only people in this world. The fact remains that Donald Trump is our President whether they like it or not and that isnt about to change. Lets hope that for the sake of everyone else in Hollywood these ignorant celebrities suck it up and deal with the fact that their candidate didnt win. Maybe if they took their heads out of their asses long enough to even listen to Trumps goals for his time in office they would feel differently. Related,,,0,0,,

Tom Pettys Autopsy: Singer Died From Massive Accidental Drug Overdose Posted on by Wolfie Tom Pettys Autopsy: Singer Died From Massive Accidental Drug Overdose Tom Pettys autopsy results are in and they show the singer died from an accidental drug overdose as a result of taking a variety of medications. The L.A. County Coroner says a number of Toms organs failed due to ""mixed drug toxicity."" Toms autopsy report shows the singer was on several pain meds including Fentanyl patches oxycodone (Oxycontin) temazepam (Restoril) alprazolam (Xanax) citalopram (Celexa) acetyl fentanyl and despropionyl fentanyl. The reason doctors prescribed the meds was because of a number of medical problems including emphysema knee problems and a fractured hip. The family says the linchpin to Toms demise was the fractured hip. He insisted on touring for 53 concert dates with the condition which worsened over time and caused him to take the meds. On the date he had the heart attack he was told his hip had graduated to a full-on break that made the pain unbearable and may have caused the overuse of meds. The autopsy says Petty suffered from coronary artery atherosclerosis. As we reported ... Toms official death certificate left his cause of death as ""deferred"" leaving it as a mystery until now. We broke the story ... Tom went into full cardiac arrest before being taken to a hospital in L.A. He eventually died when his family took him off life support. Fentanyl was also linked to the deaths of Prince and Lil Peep. Tom was 66. TOPICS: Culture/Society KEYWORDS: addiction druggie junkie justsayno lifechoices opioids petty To: Wolfie Fentanyl?

Psychiatrist Who Made Baseless Claim Against Trump Has Expired Medical License Conservative Daily News ^ | Jan 12 2018 | Jim Clayton Posted on by upchuck The Yale University psychology professor who called in her conclusion that President Trump was mentally impaired was recently criticized for ignoring well-established protocol. She made her diagnosis without ever actually examining the president. Now she faces additional criticism for another professional faux pas. It appears that Professor Bandy Lee is not currently licensed to practice psychology in her own state of Connecticut. Campus Reform discovered that Lees physician/surgeon license in Connecticut expired more than two years ago on May 31 2015 and she hasnt applied for a renewal since then. In addition Lees controlled substance registration for practitioner license expired nearly a year ago in February of 2017. In response to Campus Reforms inquiry on the matter Lee simply stated that I need only one license though she has yet to elaborate on precisely which license that is and according to the state in which she resides she allegedly has none. Lee didnt merely publish her diagnosis she took it to Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers. Yale News reported: On Dec. 5 and 6 Lee met with more than a dozen congressmen including one Republican senator Politico reported. In her presentation Lee relied on the assessments of 27 mental health professionals compiled in the book she edited The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump. Though she could not diagnose Trump without a formal evaluation she said Trumps recent behavior shows that he may be a danger to the American public (Excerpt) Read more at conservativedailynews.com ...

That might make sense for someone who is a tenured professor but she is not tenured. She is a marginal player who cannot practice psychiatry nor should she be teaching it. To: tomkat We are finding that talk therapy especially of the cognitive behavioral variety which means having the patient challenge the negative and defeating thoughts in their heads is superior to chemotherapy in which the doctor is introducing drugs the mechanisms and pathways of which are dimly or entirely not understood. Its turning into a lopsided argument. Talk therapy works. Drug therapy controls symptoms. They even admit it.

Federal debt skyrocketed under Obama. He was printing money by the end of his reign. This is unheard of in our history. He ran the country like a banana republic said Denzel Washington at a New York screening of his new film the legal drama Roman J. Israel Esq. Asked by a reporter whether his information about Obama was correct Denzel Washington confirmed that it was absolutely correct. He also criticized mainstream media for attempting to turn Obama into a kind of idol. Why arent they discussing the facts? They think we are too stupid to understand the metrics? Denzel Washington said explaining that he had seen a segment about Obamas legacy that blew my mind and left me raging. There were more ready-and-willing workers out of the labor force than ever before by the time that guy left office. Obama blew it for America big time and now they are trying to portray him as some kind of idol? The number of people in America on food stamps more than tripled in his second term. More than tripled! Average family income went down dramatically. Home ownership rates across America went down the toilet. Obama and his cronies sold us out. Real American workers have never had less of a share of the economy. The Equalizer actor also explained that while many of his Hollywood peers were groomed by the Obamas with invitations to parties in the White House black-tie balls and barbecues on the lawn he wasnt extended the same treatment. He knew I was very suspect about him. I have always been very suspect about him. Where did he come from? What was he really doing before running for office? His history sure isnt what they say.

836,http://www.trumpsolidsupporters.me/2018/01/queen-elizabeth-removes-obamas-from.html,https://www.snopes.com/queen-elizabeth-remove-obamas-guest-list/,2017-12-06,3000.0,false,Queen Elizabeth has personally removed Michelle and Barack Obama from the guest list for Prince Harrys wedding to Meghan Markle according to British reports. Invitations to Royal weddings in England have traditionally been extended to the sitting President of the United States and the current First Lady so when Queen Elizabeth saw what Michelle Obama was up to trying to sneak a spot at the wedding at the expense of the real POTUS and FLOTUS she delivered Michelle a well-deserved and humiliating beatdown. While Barack Obama has been traveling around the world operating as some kind of shadow president and attempting to undermine the real POTUS Michelle has been trying to push her way into every major social event where she doesnt belong and is apparently not invited. When Michelle Obama heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl she assumed it was her rightful place to be on that guest list. Michelle made a desperate move to sneak a spot on the guest list but unfortunately for the former First Lady the guest list has to be approved by the Queen of England herself. As soon as Buckingham Palace announced the news that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were officially engaged the opportunistic Obamas saw their chance to edge their way into the elites like a couple of desperate kids trying to hang with the popular crowd at school. Barack immediately got on social media to beat President Trump to the congratulatory punch. Barack has a lot more time on his hands than the current POTUS who is cleaning up the mess he left behind. Barack who had been practically stalking Prince Harry on Twitter in recent weeks made a post within seconds of the news coming out which served the purpose of letting the Royals know that he and Michelle were angling for an invitation to the wedding of the year. The Obamas are experts at playing the crowd for fools and Baracks sycophantic post got a whopping one million likes. The Obamas were likely over the moon about this return on their cynical investment because it meant Prince Harry and the Royal Family were likely to see it and a seat at the high table was surely theirs for the taking. The exposure of Baracks post sparked rumors that the Obamas would likely be added to the guest list at the expense of the current president and first lady Londons Independent reported. But while Barack was busy sending desperate tweets and DMs to secretly get on the coveted guest list Michelle was doing something worse to shove the Trumps aside and ensure her spot even though the honor is traditionally reserved for the current president and first lady. Michelle has been doing the rounds on the speaking tour lately trying to rack in hundreds of thousands of dollars and trash Trump at the same time. Her recent trip to Canada was no exception. She combined her usual trash talk with the hidden goal of getting to the historic royal wedding. Addressing the Economic Club of Toronto Michelle deviated from her usual Trump bashing shtick and went into overdrive kissing up to the Queen of England at every opportunity and criticizing POTUS Trump whenever possible. Michelle really wanted that wedding invite. According to Page Six Michelle took the opportunity to make fun of President Trump then immediately gushed over the queen. Both conversation deviations had no place in an event like this but for calculated Michelle it has a passive-aggressive purpose of saying that Trump wasnt fit for her guest list but since she loves the Queen so much she should get a spot. After being introduced by Canadas first lady Sophie Trudeau Obama told the crowd that it is never a good idea to put your first thought in the morning on social media and never a good idea to tweet from bed which appears to be one of the presidents favorite pastimes presuming that he is actually in bed when he tweets at 3 a.m Page Six reported. Going on about effective communication and the importance of doing drafts Obama went on Then you need to edit and spell-check it. The 45-minute conversation hosted by the Economic Club of Toronto flowed into a bunch of amusing side stories including her memories of being awestruck when meeting Queen Elizabeth of England. What do you do with the Queen? I touched her. She touched me first she said adding that her dream dinner guest would be Jesus whom shed serve pizza. Its well known that the respect proper etiquette and holding a high-level of decorum is important to the Royal Family and by painting a picture that Trump is an impetuous buffoon who cant control himself Michelle thought she was making him look like a bad person to have at the wedding. However the bigger motive in her comments was to cover up her actual faux-pas with the Queen when not surprisingly brash Michelle showed a complete lack of respect and protocol when she got a little too touchy. The moment she bullied her way into a hug and pushed the Queen toward a chair was the moment Queen Elizabeth decided there was to be no place for Michelle or Barack Obama at the wedding The Guardian previously reported. The Queen felt so grossly disrespected by Michelle that she royally snubbed the former first lady after the touchy-feely offense. ,,,0,0,,

This rumor began circulating as soon as Trump was elected President of the United States but these idiots continue to push the matter. Our message to them DO IT. We dont need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie ODonnell think that the movie and television industry wouldnt survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are. Mike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry. He mentioned the lower paid support staff who do all of the behind the scenes work. The people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets who make the costumes who create the props and in some cases do the stunts and the special effectsMike explained. And theyre not getting the bazillion dollar deals. Its about time that these jerkoffs realize that they arent the only people in this world. The fact remains that Donald Trump is our President whether they like it or not and that isnt about to change. Lets hope that for the sake of everyone else in Hollywood these ignorant celebrities suck it up and deal with the fact that their candidate didnt win. Maybe if they took their heads out of their asses long enough to even listen to Trumps goals for his time in office they would feel different Watch one news networks story on the matter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNDjCe_tFcU,,,0,0,,

The death of Klaus Eberwein 50 the former director general of the Haitian governments economic development agency the Fonds dassistance conomique et social is the second reported suicide in a hotel room of someone who was investigating the Clinton family since May. Eberwein allegedly shot himself in the head in his Quality Inn hotel room on Tuesday just after midnight one week before he was scheduled to testify before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. Though the hearing is about the management of PetroCaribe funds he was widely expected to discuss misappropriation of earthquake donations by the Clinton Foundation. The former Haitian official had reportedly expressed concern to his peers about retaliation and fearing for his life over speaking out about the Clintons. Trending: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Knows That Bill Clinton Offered Loretta Lynch The Attorney General Job on The Tarmac The Clinton Foundation they are criminals they are thieves they are liars they are a disgrace Eberwein said while speaking at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in 2016 WND reports. On May 14 Republican operative and donor Peter W. Smith 81 was found dead in his Minnesota hotel room from an apparent suicide. His death came 10 days before the publication of a story he had given to the Wall Street Journal regarding Russian hackers and Hillary Clintons 33000 missing emails which he had been seeking. Smith was found dead in his hotel room after allegedly suffocating himself with a plastic bag and helium. According to a report from the WSJ Smiths suicide note made sure to declare that there was no foul play which in itself has lead many people to question what really happened. He reportedly wrote that there was no foul play no one assisted him he had a recent bad turn of health and that his life insurance policy would soon expire. Smith had been the No. 1 financial backer of Mr. [Newt] Gingrich and one of the top 20 contributors nationwide so it is unclear why he would be so concerned about finances that he would end his own life. The Republican operative had also been working to force Paul Ryan out of his role as the Speaker. Last year on August 2 a man named Shawn Lucas 38 was found dead in his apartment from a cocktail of fentanyl cyclobenzaprine and mitragynine. He had served the Democratic National Committee and Debbie Wasserman Schultz with a class action lawsuit on July 5 less than a month prior to his strange death. On August 22 Lucas was named in a motion filed by the DNC to dismiss the case due to improper service of process. Though these cases have not received the same amount of exposure as the mysterious death of Seth Rich they are just a few of the most recent in a pattern of deaths that seem to benefit one single political family.,,,0,0,,

Unlike others who have earned this anti-honor such as 9/11 attacker Osama bin Laden and Boston mob boss James E. Whitey Bulger she is suspected in the death of only one person. Wanted by the FBI: Yolanda Torres Houston homicide detectives told the FBI that the victim was gathering his belongings from his car when a gunman approached from behind and shot him. He died a short time later. The FBI is after her for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. FBI officials call the jilted Torres a master manipulator who recruited one of her co-conspirators after telling him she had cartel ties and could supply him with drugs as well as money and a car. That man and a woman who officials believe was the getaway driver during the Jan 5 crime she is still a fugitive. Torres has been charged with capital murder.

Federal debt skyrocketed under Obama. He was printing money by the end of his reign. This is unheard of in our history. He ran the country like a banana republic said Denzel Washington at a New York screening of his new film the legal drama Roman J. Israel Esq. Asked by a reporter whether his information about Obama was correct Denzel Washington confirmed that it was absolutely correct. He also criticized mainstream media for attempting to turn Obama into a kind of idol. Why arent they discussing the facts? They think we are too stupid to understand the metrics? Denzel Washington said explaining that he had seen a segment about Obamas legacy that blew my mind and left me raging. There were more ready-and-willing workers out of the labor force than ever before by the time that guy left office. Obama blew it for America big time and now they are trying to portray him as some kind of idol? The number of people in America on food stamps more than tripled in his second term. More than tripled! Average family income went down dramatically. Home ownership rates across America went down the toilet. Obama and his cronies sold us out. Real American workers have never had less of a share of the economy. The Equalizer actor also explained that while many of his Hollywood peers were groomed by the Obamas with invitations to parties in the White House black-tie balls and barbecues on the lawn he wasnt extended the same treatment. He knew I was very suspect about him. I have always been very suspect about him. Where did he come from? What was he really doing before running for office? His history sure isnt what they say. Did he go to Columbia? Who put him in power? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about Obama and his colleagues. Once upon a time this is what investigative journalists at the big newspapers would be determined to find out. Now you have all been co-opted.

Noah and Emma were the most popular childrens names in the past year reported Nos.nl. This is evident from the annual list of names of the Social Insurance Bank which pays out the child benefit. Boys were named Noah 635 times while 755 girls went through life as Emma since last year. The year before Daan and Anna were the most popular names the site said. But a journalist at Powned.tv did a little research on the report and found something completely different. Checking for Mohammed and all its alternative spellings the writer found that 636 babies had been given that name last year. Mohammed (221 times) and all possible conjugations like Mohamed (211 times) Muhammed (110 times) Mohammad (51 times) Muhammad (43 times) Mohamad (unknown) Muhamed (unknown) Muhammet (not known) Mouhamed (not known) Muhamad (not known) Mahamuud (not known) wrote the reporter. The 636 variants of the name put it one ahead of Noah. That makes Mohammed and its alternate spellings the most popular name in the Netherlands for the second straight year. In 2016 724 boys received the name (or one of the conjugations) from their parents the site reported. And then there was this: By the way how do you think about the statistics in Great Britain and Wales? The British claim that Oliver is the name given most to newborn boys . In reality this is Right Mohammed or one of his conjugations the reporter wrote citing this article. The UKs national statistics office recently released the latest data on baby names in England and Wales. It says the following: Oliver remains as the most popular first name given to baby boys in England and Wales in 2016. But thats not really true. In fact the most common name by far is Muhammad. So apparently you cant trust the mainstream media in the Netherlands either. Source: Daily Wire (Visited 55 times 1 visits today),,,0,0,,

And if polls are any indication Democrats are taking a possible Oprah run seriously too. If she runs Oprah certainly wont be the first celebrity to throw her hat into the presidential race. After all with Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump (not to mention several famous generals) theres plenty of precedent for making the jump from stardom to the West Wing. However there is at least one first that Oprah can lay claim to should she decide run: She would be the first presidential candidate to ever say that a segment of the electorate just (has) to die. Come again? Yes it seems that Oprah wasnt too keen on old people she felt were marinated in hate. So during a 2013 interview with the BBC she said that generation at least she implied its white membership needed to kick the bucket in order for progress to be made. The interview occurred as Oprah was on a publicity tour for the movie Lee Daniels The Butler in which she plays the wife of a black White House butler. (A movie which for what its worth was released by The Weinstein Company; Winfreys relationship with the disgraced media mogul/accused rapist is yet another hurdle for a prospective Oprah 2020 candidacy.) During the BBC interview she was asked whether some Americans opposed the policies of then-President Obama because they were racist according to the Washington Examiner. That little demagogic softball was de rigueur for interviewers at the time so the line of questioning certainly wasnt anything unique. Oprahs answer however was definitely of a singular nature. Of course the problem (of racism) is not solved Oprah said: As long as there are people who still theres a whole generation I say this you know I said this you know for apartheid South Africa I said this for my own you know for my own community in the South there are still generations of people older people who were born and bred and marinated in it in that prejudice and racism and they just have to die. Well thats one way to court older voters. Nobody is denying that there are racists both in the United States and abroad and supporters of apartheid in South Africa or Jim Crow in the South definitely qualify. That said Id like to shift gears for a moment here; its worth noting the slight coincidence that Monday was the day commemorating the apostle of nonviolence Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. This is Dr. Kings I Have a Dream speech. Youve probably heard bits of it or maybe even all of it but if you have 17 minutes to spare I would implore you to examine it further: Now pop quiz: Was there anywhere in the speech where you heard Dr. King say I have a dream! And in that dream those who oppose my agenda just have to die!? No. In fact during his entire career I never heard King once say that the racists who violently opposed him with the most despicable tactics available tothem and who ultimately cut short his life with a bullet to a head needed to die off. He preached radical love to benefactor and bigot alike. Another coincidence Id like to draw your attention to: At present were now having a debate over whether our president called certain nations s***hole countries and whether that was appropriate. At the same time the same political wing feigning shock and outrage over that two-word linguistic construct is now seriously considering a possible presidential candidate an individual who literally said that the nation would be better off were some citizens to die en masse. Of course liberals have jumped to Oprahs defense in this matter before. Snopes our favorite fact-challenged fact-checking site declared the supposition that Winfrey said white people had to die as false using some impressive logical gymnastics to support that position. Winfreys remarks werent specifically targeted at white people Snopes claimed. She did not say All old white people have to die or White older people have to die or any other fabricated race-based version of her actual remarks. In fact she never uttered the phrase white people at all. While she never used the phrase white people in her answer the dog-whistle inherent in what she said was more than clear and anyone who claims not to get it is either lying or too dense to be participating in this conversation. Snopes elides the fact that Winfrey was answering a question about racism against a black president and they also conveniently ignore that she named apartheid South Africa and the Jim Crow South as the milieus in which the group of people that needed to die off were marinated in hatred. When someone tacitly invokes the specter of ghouls like George Wallace P.W. Botha and Orville Faubus the only people who dont realize what race that person is referring to are those who choose to remain purposely ignorant for their own ideological reasons. Even if you still dont buy that explanation its somewhat difficult to imagine an American president who says part of her nations polity whatever their melanin content may be ought to die off. For every liberal whos tried to insinuate Donald Trump is unstable and unfit for office let it be known hes never wished the release of death upon any demographic. I admit thats a pretty low bar for any public official. It speaks volumes Oprah couldnt even manage to clear it. Please like and share on Facebook and Twitter with your thoughts on what Oprah had to say. Do you think Oprah should issue an apology for saying that people just have to die?

During his time serving the United Kingdom he trained extensively as a mechanical engineer and munitions expert and claims to be seasoned in unconventional murders involving poisons and chemicals. The retired British assassin says he worked as part of a cell of seven operatives who were trusted to conduct political assassinations during a period he describes as when MI5 operated with less external oversight. Many of his top-secret cells victims were politicians journalists activists and union leaders.Mr. Hopkins claims that Princess Diana was the only women he ever killed adding that: She was the only target where the order came directly from the Royal family. When asked about how he felt about taking the life of The Peoples Princess he said he felt ambivalent about her death describing her as a beautiful kind-hearted women who had her life cut tragically short but that she was also placing the British Crown at risk saying: The Royal Family had evidence that she was planning to divorce Charles. She knew too many Royal Secrets. She had a huge grudge and she was going to go public with all sorts of wild claims. My boss told me she had to die hed received orders directly from Prince Philip and we had to make it look like an accident. Id never killed a woman before much less a princess but I obeyed orders. I did it for Queen and country. He claims the operation was run under strict control from Buckingham Palace in direct cooperation with the mainstream media. The high-level conspiracy involved collusion between the media and Palace to square their stories make sure everybody was on the same page. It was a well-run operation. Speaking about the conspirators in the operation Hopkins said: British journalists all answer to editors who answer to oligarchs who all want knighthoods from the crime family at Buckingham Palace. There is no free press in Britain We got away with murder. After being told that he only has a short time left to live from his doctors Hopkins said he will spend his final weeks at home but admitted that he expects to be arrested after his admissions or even silenced saying: I cant say that I care an awful lot. If they try to take me out theyll be doing me a favor now He explained that he would be long-gone should an investigation be opened as it would take forever and be very complicated due to the limited records on the operations adding that most of my colleagues are already dead. Hopkins claims that the main conspirator in the murder of Princess Diana was Prince Philip but said that he will never be charged with anything of course. If Prince Philip ever lets himself be analyzed by a psychiatrist Im sure hed be diagnosed a psychopath. He has all the dark triad traits. Should this case ever be investigated the most important witness would be Mr. Hopkins boss who apparently died of a heart attack in the early 2000s. When Hopkins was asked why he didnt expose the plot earlier or refuse the job at the time he explained: MI5 agents swear allegiance to the Crown We cant be impartial when it comes to the Royal family. At best I would have been done for treason at worst Philip would have designed a grisly fate for me.,,,0,0,,
876,https://toptips.news/know-energy-drinks-made-semen-bull-urine/,https://www.snopes.com/food/ingredient/bullsemen.asp,2016-09-21,476.0,false,Energy drinks or hypertonic drinks are alcohol-free drinks and with some stimulating virtues that have been on the world market for more than two decades offering consumers the avoidance or decrease of fatigue and exhaustion as well as increase mental ability and detoxify the body. They are composed mainly of caffeine various vitamins carbohydrates and other natural organic substances like taurine which eliminate the feeling of exhaustion of the person who consumes them. They should not be confused with re-moisturizing beverages or with other types of beverages such as soda since even in the same containers it is advised that they are not considered moisturizing drinks. Containing high doses of caffeine may produce dependence. Part of the sense of well-being produced by energy drinks is caused by an energy effect that is produced by the action of psychoactive substances (caffeine an alkaloid one of the ingredients in these drinks) acting on the central nervous system Inhibiting the neurotransmitters responsible for transmitting the feelings of tiredness sleep etc. and enhancing those related to feelings of well-being and concentration. Caffeine for example manages to increase the extracellular levels of the neurotransmitters noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex of the brain which explains much of its favorable effects on concentration. But recently a study by the Longhorn Cattle Company that has shocked everyone as they revealed an ingredient extracted from the bulls urine and semen which were tested in the best brands such as Red Bull and Monster. Secret Ingredient of Energy Drinks: Taurine is the so-called American Taurus ingredient that means bull. The tuarine was isolated for the first time from the bile of an ox in 1827 the Australian scientists Leopold Gmelin and Friedrich Tiedemann. It is classified as an amino acid but lacks a carboxyl group. Taurine is usually found in the semen of bulls liver and urine Disgusting right? Unfortunately this is the secret ingredient of all energy drinks. Certainly taurine has been synthesized and there are replicas of this compound made in laboratories. But what we should ask ourselves is whether the drinks are using the synthetic version or the extracted version of the urine. How to extract taurine from bulls: In the following video we can see how it is extracted from the bulls. This video was recorded by one of the employees of the company who offer numerous energy drinks with this ingredient. The video was discovered by mistake and leaked which we can see below: Side Effects of Taurine: Taurine in its natural form shows positive effects on the cardiovascular system nervous system and immune system. Excessive use of taurine can lead to toxic levels. The most common symptoms of intoxication are gastrointestinal. Energy drinks often combine taurine with substances such as caffeine. Reliable results on the safety of mixing taurine with other ingredients are not yet available which may be a concern in the health community. Now that you know the secret of taurine that have the most popular energy drinks in the world you have the last decision to know if you continue to consume or not.

An explosive report by The Gateway Pundit reveals that there may be a reason for his support beyond Schumers purported love of Mexican criminals above our veterans and poor children. In fact there is a reason. $500000 of them in fact. Transparency website Glass Tabletop revealed Saturday that just before the Friday evening vote Schumer received three separate campaign donation from Immigration for Everyone the Council for Alien Rights and the Southern Border Defense Fund three groups that regularly push for complete amnesty for all illegals. Thanks to this donation and his hatred of President Trump Schumer was more than willing to encourage his fellow Democrats to vote against keeping the government open. 90% of them listened. Only five Democrats summoned enough patriotism to vote FOR America. 2018 is our chance to reaffirm that we want Donald Trumps America that we want freedom and democracy and rule of law. Its time for us to not be willing to settle for a majority. We must completely take Congress from the hands of the Democrat Party. AMERICA FIRST!,,,0,0,,

But looking back at history the brainwashing started much earlier. According to our German source this was a 2006 series about a woman who became Muslim and told her son that every child is a Muslim. Decide for yourself what you see and how this will influence the viewpoints of children: In another video the recent knife murder of a young German girl by an Afghan migrant is downplayed as a romantic drama. It is another form of propaganda that ignores dangerous honour crimes within Muslim communities. Instead it focuses on the dangers of right-wing viewpoints and demonstrations.,,"7qfe7j,",70,7,"The_Donald,","Lack-of-Focus,"

I dont care what you guys do. Hell you can even go back to drunken driving. Just stop eating laundry detergent for Christs sake said Gen. Robert Neller the Marine Commandant. Top officials have expressed concern in recent days over a number of incidents involving enlisted troops taking part in the Tide Pod Challenge a viral internet campaign that challenges people to put laundry detergent in their mouth in order to raise awareness for Charles Darwin. Although health experts have issued various statements explaining the challenge could be deadly a number of Marines have taken this as a challenge in itself to prove their battlefield prowess. Nobody is going to tell me I cant eat Tide Pods if I want to said Lance Cpl. Evan Miller from his hospital bed. According to barracks sources over the weekend Miller attempted to eat three pods at the same time before chasing it with his favorite Burnt Sienna-flavored crayon. So far the number of Marines hospitalized due to poisoning from the challenge has been less than 100 though defense officials fear that number will rise as more Marines pass on troublesome rumors that they can eat Tide Pods to give them more energy on hikes or give them a boost in upper body strength. Lets just pray that no one starts a rumor that the Spartans ate Tide Pods before battle Neller said.

Federal debt skyrocketed under Obama. He was printing money by the end of his reign. This is unheard of in our history. He ran the country like a banana republic said Denzel Washington at a New York screening of his new film the legal drama Roman J. Israel Esq. Asked by a reporter whether his information about Obama was correct Denzel Washington confirmed that it was absolutely correct. He also criticized mainstream media for attempting to turn Obama into a kind of idol. Why arent they discussing the facts? They think we are too stupid to understand the metrics? Denzel Washington said explaining that he had seen a segment about Obamas legacy that blew my mind and left me raging. There were more ready-and-willing workers out of the labor force than ever before by the time that guy left office. Obama blew it for America big time and now they are trying to portray him as some kind of idol? The number of people in America on food stamps more than tripled in his second term. More than tripled! Average family income went down dramatically. Home ownership rates across America went down the toilet. Obama and his cronies sold us out. Real American workers have never had less of a share of the economy. The Equalizer actor also explained that while many of his Hollywood peers were groomed by the Obamas with invitations to parties in the White House black-tie balls and barbecues on the lawn he wasnt extended the same treatment. He knew I was very suspect about him. I have always been very suspect about him. Where did he come from? What was he really doing before running for office? His history sure isnt what they say. Did he go to Columbia? Who put him in power? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about Obama and his colleagues.<> Once upon a time this is what investigative journalists at the big newspapers would be determined to find out.

Mueller III into the Trump campaigns false ties to Russia. He has emerged as a visible nemesis of Americans appearing almost daily on television to discuss the various fake investigations of President Trump. Little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and Clapper! President Trump tweeted referring to former James B. Comey the former F.B.I. director; Senator Mark Warner Democrat of Virginia; John O. Brennan the former C.I.A. director; and James R. Clapper Jr. the former director of national intelligence. Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped! Coincidentally Adam Schiffs sister is the estranged wife of globalist George Soros son. Billionaire George Soross son Robert and his estranged wife Melissa Schiff are at risk of forfeiting their entire art collection including pieces by Jeff Koons and Christopher Wool if they cant agree on its value his lawyer said. The former couple were in Manhattan Supreme Court Wednesday for the opening day of their $350 million divorce trial. Soros attorney Alan Feigenbaum said their prenuptial agreement states that if the parties cannot agree on a valueproperty should be sold. But Schiffs lawyer Bernard Clair disputed that interpretation. He argued that an appeals court ruled in April that the prenup does not address the disposition of marital art. Soros who until recently ran his fathers $28 billion investment management firm wants to sell off their collection while Schiff wants to keep selected pieces. Theyre also fighting over a $5.85 million Rhinebeck farm which Schiff testified that she loves more than anything.

If the Democrats had won the election we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We would never have known this. Think about it! said Denzel Washington at a press conference in New York. They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections said Denzel Washington who has just been nominated for an Oscar for his film Roman J. Israel Esq. The nomination marks the eighth time Washington has been nominated in the best actor category making him the most-nominated African-American actor of all time. Asked by a reporter if he was sure the memo released by Congress on Friday was reliable Denzil Washington said Hell yeah its reliable. We dont need to know the nitty-gritty to understand exactly whats happened here. We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. You guys cant see what is wrong with this? Youre kidding me The Equalizer actor said before adding Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about the Democratic Party. I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But youve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet.

918,http://archive.is/DJ2L1,https://www.snopes.com/trump-turkey-pardons-reversed/,2017-01-25,4000.0,false,WASHINGTON D.C. In another sweeping move aimed at undoing the perceived damage done by the Obama administration President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday directing the Department of Justice to revoke all sixteen Thanksgiving Day turkey pardons issued by the former president during his eight years in office. After reviewing the decisions made by the previous administration President Trump has determined that a number of turkey pardons issued by Barack Obama were done so in a manner that was both deceitful and hazardous to the American people White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced on Tuesday. This morning the president once again used his executive powers to see to it that justice is served and that the surviving creatures will be destroyed. Spicer said very little is known about the true origins of the sixteen turkeys or why they were specifically singled out by former President Barack Obama. There are a lot of obvious questions we just dont have the answers to. Were they connected to radical Islamic terrorism? Black Lives Matter extremists? We cant be sure he said. All we know is they were sentenced to death and Obama took it upon himself to meddle in the independent judicial process. Of the sixteen turkeys pardoned by Obama all but five are deceased. These birds despite their deaths will have their pardons revoked posthumously during a ceremony in the Rose Garden Secretary Spicer explained. The remaining birds Tater Tot Abe Honest and Cheese are scheduled to be remanded into federal custody on Friday before they are turned over to officials from the Federal Bureau of Prisons who are under orders to execute the turkeys by firing squad. The annual Thanksgiving Day turkey pardon dates back to 1863 when President Abraham Lincoln first granted clemency to his sons beloved pet turkey which the First Family had intended to feast on for Thanksgiving dinner.,,,0,0,,

In the city of Tokyo (Japan) the first restaurant in the world that legally offers Humana meat was inaugurated. A scary restaurant nicknamed The Resoto ototo no shoku ryohin which means in English Edible Brother opened its doors to the Japanese public and from all over the world where it offers its customers a varied menu where prices vary from 100 up to 1000 euros that is to say the dish with human flesh more expensive would be 1193 US dollars. International news sources have reported that a tourist from the country of Argentina was the first man to eat human flesh in the Edible Brother. This diner I think the following: It seems like eating pork in this restaurant they cook the meat with spices so the taste goes unnoticed. In Japan since 2014 a law was approved that allows the consumption of human flesh obviously conserving conditions such as the sanitary level of this and the origin. However there is no doubt that at least 99% of the world population would not agree with these grotesque acts so to speak. And the question we all ask ourselves how do they get the meat? The people before dying decide to sell their bodies to the peculiar restaurant approximately for about 30 thousand euros or 35799 dollars this is the balance that those interested can leave their families logically they are the only ones who can claim the money. Only people who die young can sign the contract in which they are subject to a special diet where the meat is suitable for consumption. source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSKu0QF_m2g Source : https://steemit.com/food/@jomano1975/they-open-the-first-restaurant-of-human-meat-in-the-world,,,0,0,,

This is actually a very long season of The Office with our new president playing the role of a self-obsessed buffoon who clearly thinks hes smart funny kind and successful.

955,http://christmasdailygifts.info/?p=1636,https://www.snopes.com/pedophile-priest-crucified/,2018-01-26,394.0,false,A pedophile priest who was found guilty of raping 30 children while infected with HIV but forgiven by the Vatican has been found dead outside his church.Earlier this year Catholic priest Jose Garcia Ataulfo admitted to raping 30 young girls aged between 5 and 10 years old in Oaxaca Southern Mexico. Ataulfo was cleared of any wrong doing by the church and didnt face any criminal charges despite the fact that he knew he was infected with HIV when he sexually abused all the children he is known to have raped. As part of Pope Franciss more merciful approach to child abusing clergy Ataulfo was relocated to a different church to seek prayer and forgiveness for his sins. Now it seems as though his past has caught up with him after his dead body was found crucified outside his new church in a rural area of Villa Alta. Ataulfo was found tied from a wooden beam that was hanging from a large tree branch by members of his congregation who had arrived for Sunday mass to find the church closed. According to local police he had been beaten before he was crucified and his genitals had been removed and placed in his mouth. He also had hot road tar poured onto the top of his head which appears to have been done as torture after he was hung up but while he was still alive. His robes had been removed and burned on the floor and he had been dressed in rags and had a wooden plaque nailed to his hand that was engraved with the words: I am no man of God I am a demon. I will pay for my crimes in hell. Police believe that he may have been killed by the violent drug gang known as the Knights Templar. The Knights Templar Cartel (Spanish: Los Caballeros Templarios) is a Mexican criminal organization composed of remnants of the defunct La Familia Michoacana drug cartel and are known for their brutal executions. According to local media reports it is thought that Ataulfo may have had a price on his head for his past crimes and the cartel may have been tipped off as to where he had been relocated to. Speaking to reporters police spokesman Manuel Moreno Rivas said: This looks like the work of a cartel so we wont get any answers on this one. We might as well chalk this case up as a suicide. I dont think anyone will lose any sleep over that will they? We heard what this guy had done to those kids so lets just leave it there. Ataulfo admitted to sexually assaulting well over two dozen children many of whom were indigenous young girls from Oaxaca a state in southern Mexico known for its large indigenous population. The mother of one of the priests victims wrote a letter to The Pope asking to meet with him in Rome to discuss the case but was shunned by the Vatican who declared that the matter is closed. Due to the significant influence that the Catholic Church wields in Mexico the priest didnt face any criminal charges particularly for his crimes in areas populated by indigenous ethnic groups. The report which first appeared on the Spanish language news site Urgente24.com says the priest was absolved of any wrongdoing by the Archdiocese of Mexico. Earlier this year Pope Francis announced that the church would be reducing penalties for pedophile priests by relocating them to a different church and offering them support rather than punishing them. The Pope said that the controversial measures were designed to create a more merciful church. According to The Daily Mail sexual abuse of minors by priests and the subsequent cover ups by bishops and other Church officials have been widespread in many countries including the United States. The issue was thrust into the national spotlight in 2002 when the Boston Globe revealed the extent to which the local archdiocese shielded abusive priests from being exposed to the public even though it knew they posed a danger to young parishioners. The Globe expos which detailed abuse cases that numbered in the thousands over a span of several decades inspired other victims to come forward leading to an avalanche of lawsuits and criminal prosecutions. Not only did the floodgates open in the US but the Catholic Church was also forced to confront cases in other countries including Mexico. In 2004 the Vatican re opened a prior investigation against Marcial Maciel who was accused of sexually abusing minors as well as fathering six children by three different women. Though the allegations spanned decades and the extent of his crimes was known to church officials it was only in 2006 that the Vatican forced Maciel one of its most powerful clergymen to retire from active ministry.

She spread her talents across costume (The Age of Innocence) romance (Frankie and Johnny) fantasy (The Witches of Eastwick) and comedy (Married to the Mob) genres. . And in a rare feat for actors she even managed to receive universal critical acclaim for her interpretation of an iconic character Catwoman in Batman Returns.

The 28-year-old employee was found partially naked and unconscious when security agents discovered the young man and alerted an ambulance. It took medical personnel several hours to successfully release the octopus that had latched itself to the mans genital area. We did the best we could but the octopuss beak has tremendous pressure and the animal had started to digest part of the mans genitals explained Dr. Julia Andrews of the San Diego Medical Center. When we separated the animal from his body his penis had been severely slashed and was hanging by a thread she added. We also opened the stomach of the octopus only to find the partial remains of a digested testicle she told reporters. Lucky to be alive Although the young man is still lying in critical condition health officials do not worry for his life. He has lost a lot of blood but its a good thing he got here on time explained his father to reporters. I dont know what the hell he was thinking screwing with that sea critter but with a little reconstructive surgery the doctor said hell be as good as new his father said visibly relieved. I knew he was into heavy metal music and weird satanic stuff but I didnt know it was that bad added his mother in tears. A San Diego Zoo spokesman told reporters that the incident was tragic and deplorable and that an investigation would take place to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.,,,0,0,,

Haitians have been protesting for years outside of the Clinton Foundation offices over the theft of money that was donated by individuals and businesses to the Clinton Foundation that never made it to the poorest of the poor. One man was set to testify against the Clinton Foundation next week. That man was 50 year old former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein. He was found dead in his Miami home with a gunshot to the head thats been ruled a suicide by the Miami-Dades medical examiner records supervisor. (Think Vince Foster) Klaus Eberwein a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week has been found dead in Miami. He was 50. Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors. Eberwein who had acknowledged his life was in danger was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundations activities in the Caribbean island where he served as director general of the governments economic development agency Fonds dassistance conomique et social for three years. According to Eberwein a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% or $5.4 billion was funneled to non-Haitian organizations. The Clinton Foundation they are criminals they are thieves they are liars they are a disgrace Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year. The former director general of Haiti who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti Muncheez and even has a pizza the Klaus Special named after him. According to the Haiti Libre newspaper Eberwein was said to be in good spirits with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide. Its really shocking said Muncheezs owner Gilbert Bailly. We grew up together; he was like family. Your News Wire Americans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016 former Senate President of Haiti Bernard Sansaricq shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clintons dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind and to expose the crimes of the Clintons who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House. Sansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to side with the Clinton Administration and he would be the richest man in Haiti. He also demanded that Hillary Clinton disclose the audit of all money related to the Haiti earthquake crisis as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation. Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump we are asking you begging you the Haitian community will side with you if one day you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti.

If the Democrats had won the election we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it! said Denzel Washington at a press conference in New York. They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections said Denzil Washington who has just been nominated for an Oscar for his film Roman J. Israel Esq. The nomination marks the eighth time Washington has been nominated in the best actor category making him the most-nominated African-American actor of all time. Asked by a reporter if he was sure the memo released by Congress on Friday was reliable Denzil Washington said Hell yeah its reliable. We dont need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly whats happened here. We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. You guys cant see what is wrong with this? Youre kidding me The Equalizer actor said before adding Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about the Democratic Party. I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But youve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided a war with Russia and we avoided the creation of an Orwellian police state. Roman J. Israel Esq. is available digitally now with the Blu-ray and DVD hitting shelves Feb. 13.

In a draft guidance document released in December 2017 the FDA takes aim at homeopathic remedies or as they put it drug products labeled as homeopathic.23 In a reversal of a long-standing decision to treat homeopathic remedies differently from other drugs the FDA has now labeled virtually all of these products as new drugs that are subject to FDA enforcement action at any time. While deaths from drugs like opioids are now a public health crisis homeopathy has maintained a much lower and presumably safer profile. Yet the FDA is using its limited resources to target the latter citing a need to protect consumers who choose to use homeopathic products. Why now? The FDA also cited a large uptick in products labeled as homeopathic that are being marketed for a wide array of diseases and conditions to the extent that homeopathic products are now a close to $3 billion industry.4 Perhaps thats $3 billion too much for Big Pharma FDAs cozy partner in crime. [I]n one fell swoop the FDA has declared that virtually every single homeopathic drug on the market is being sold illegally the Alliance for Natural Health USA (ANH USA) wrote5 and its not an exaggeration. In essence the FDAs guidance reads:6 Any homeopathic drug that has not been considered generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/E) is considered a new drug FDA has not determined that any homeopathic drugs are GRAS/E A new drug cannot be marketed unless it goes through the FDAs approval process No homeopathic drugs have gone through FDA approval nor can any producer afford to take them through the approval process The FDA then states that its proposing a new risk-based enforcement approach and first plans to target the unapproved drug products labeled as homeopathic that have the greatest potential to cause risk to patients. This includes:7 Products with reported safety concerns Products that contain or claim to contain ingredients associated with potentially significant safety concerns Products for routes of administration other than oral and topical Products intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of serious and/or life-threatening diseases and conditions Products for vulnerable populations Products that do not meet standards of quality strength or purity as required under the law FDA Does About-Face Penalizes an Entire Industry The draft guidance is a complete turnaround from the FDAs prior stance on homeopathic remedies which stated under the 1988 Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 400.400 Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed they did not need to get FDA approval prior to coming on the market. Instead the ingredients in homeopathic remedies were to be verified by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS). As noted by law firm Venable:8 Essentially the HPUS creates a monograph for homeopathic drugs to follow not dissimilar to the OTC drug monographs that FDA has developed for allopathic drugs. Accordingly by virtue of an ingredients inclusion in the HPUS the ingredient has already been closely examined and determined to be safe and effective by the HPCUS [Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention of the United States]. Compliance with the HPUS functions as a premarket review of safety and effectiveness in the homeopathic context. By classifying homeopathic drugs as unapproved new drugs the FDA is requiring a second showing of safety and effectiveness a step that is unnecessary not to mention impractical given that the Agency intends to hold homeopathic products to an allopathic standard that is inappropriate given the nature of homeopathic products. Further it was by the FDAs own deliberate decision that homeopathic drugs were excluded from former drug approval processes and intended to be a separate category. Venable continued:9 The FDA deliberately excluded homeopathic drugs from both the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) review (the process by which all drugs approved between 1938 and 1962 were retrospectively evaluated by the FDA for effectiveness) and the OTC Drug Review in 1972 (the process used to develop OTC drug monographs for allopathic drugs) deciding instead in the latter case to regulate homeopathic products separately because of their uniqueness. By withdrawing the CPG and classifying all homeopathic drugs as unapproved drugs subject to FDA drug approval the FDA is now requiring higher regulatory thresholds for OTC homeopathic drugs than are applicable to allopathic OTC drugs many of which are permitted to be sold pursuant to the FDA monograph system. This move in effect penalizes an entire industry for the Agencys 1972 decision. FTC Targeted Homeopathy in 2016 The FDA isnt the first government agency to target this centuries old natural medicine system. In a notice filed in November 2016 the FTC stated that in order for homeopathic remedies to claim they are effective their makers must provide proof. If no proof is provided the remedies must state there is no scientific evidence that the product works. In order to not mislead consumers the FTC further stated that homeopathic remedies lacking sufficient proof must communicate to consumers that the products claims are based only on theories of homeopathy from the 1700s that are not accepted by most modern medical experts.10 Dana Ullman MPH CCH one of the leading advocates for homeopathy in the U.S. said at the time:11 Considering the longtime safety history of homeopathic medicines it is surprising and even shocking that the FTC would consider proposing new regulations now. One cannot help but wonder who or what is pulling their strings policies commonly result from powerful economic forces at play it is clear that this governmental agency is ignoring important scientific evidence and one must wonder if they are protecting Big Pharma from competition more than protecting the consumer. Does Homeopathy Work? Based on the theory that like cures like or the Law of Similars homeopathy was founded by German physician Dr. Samuel Hahnemann. The idea is that health conditions can be healed by treating a person with minute doses of a substance that would produce similar symptoms to their health condition if given in larger doses. Homeopathys other guiding principle is that of the minimum dose which is based on the premise that the more a substance is diluted the more potent homeopathic remedy it becomes known as the law of infinitesimals. Homeopathic remedies may be made from plants minerals or other substances and are commonly administered in pellet form dissolved under the tongue. A number of intriguing studies suggest homeopathy is effective and safe for a variety of ailments including flu. According to Ullman: The use of a homeopathic medicine called Oscillococcinum is an example of a remedy that can be effective for many people with the flu though clinical experience suggests that it is most effective when used within 48 hours of getting flu symptoms. Although most homeopathic medicines are made from the plant or mineral kingdom Oscillococcinum is unusual in that it is made from the heart and liver of a duck. In one study nearly twice as many patients who were given Oscillococcinum recovered from the flu within 48 hours as those given a placebo.12 Further Ullman noted: A different group of researchers conducted a randomized double-blind study involving 372 patients (188 treated with Oscillococcinum and 187 with placebo) of both sexes ranging in age from 12 to 60 who presented rectal temperature 100.4 F muscle pains headache or at least one of the following symptoms: shivering chest pain spine pain coughing irritation of nasal mucosa or feeling of malaise.13 Patients received three tubes of Oscillococcinum or placebo each day (morning noon and night) for three days. The results of this trial show a highly statistically significant difference between the two groups for what concerns disappearance of symptoms after 48 hours (19.2 percent in the Oscillococcinum group versus 17.1 percent in the placebo group) and improvement in symptoms (43.7 percent versus 38.6 percent for placebo). Additional research shows homeopathys promising role in the following conditions: In patients with allergies those using homeopathy reported improvements in nasal airflow compared with a placebo group. With homeopathic treatment the researchers described a clear significant and clinically relevant improvement in nasal inspiratory peak flow similar to that found with topical steroids.14 Homeopathy significantly reduced the severity and duration of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis (swelling and sores in the mouth) in children.15 Homeopathic medicine was effective in treating acute childhood diarrhea decreasing both the duration of the diarrhea and the number of stools per day.1617 Homeopathy has positive effects in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) particularly in the areas of behavioral and cognitive functions.18 Homeopathy lessened tender point pain and improved quality of life in people with fibromyalgia.19 Homeopathic was effective in treating the early stages of vitiligo in a report of 14 cases20 FDA Continues to Crack Down on Natural Substances Protect Big Pharma The FDAs new push to regulate homeopathic products is eerily reminiscent of their recent crackdown on the plant kratom. Leaves from the kratom tree have been used for pain relief for hundreds of years but scientists now know they contain compounds that target the brain similarly to opioids helping to relieve pain. It appears the plant may be safer than opioids for pain relief and could even act as a tool to help those suffering from opioid withdrawal. In November 2017 however rather than targeting the prescription opioids that are the root of the opioid epidemic the FDA issued a public health advisory regarding risks associated with kratom use suggesting that its usage could expand the opioid epidemic. What this comes down to for some is the right to choose what form of medicine to put in your body. As Dr. Lee Hieb an orthopedic surgeon and past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons wrote in WND:21 Im not here to tout any particular over-the-counter remedy but who gave the FDA total ability to limit what we can take into our bodies while virtually forcing us to be given what they prescribe? Its none of their business whether a homeopathic remedy is worthless. Thats an issue of commerce and truth in advertising. I for one want the freedom to research and decide for myself what supplements to take even if my supplements ultimately do me no good. (Many do a great deal of good as Big Pharma knows only too well.) People have the right to choose their treatment and doctors (many of whom admit to prescribing placebos to their patients) also retain the right to offer treatments they deem useful whether it be homeopathy or another remedy. As for the FDAs new draft guidance on homeopathic drugs its attempting to discredit such remedies proven healing powers before their mechanisms of action have even been fully understood. If you want to express your opinion on the matter the FDA is accepting comments from the public until March 30 2018.,,,0,0,,
975,http://econewsmedia.org/2018/02/01/nfl-lawyer-claimed-super-bowl-rigged-found-dead/,https://www.snopes.com/nfl-lawyer-dead/,2018-01-29,588.0,false,An NFL entertainment lawyer who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is rigged. Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an gangland-style execution hours after blowing the whistle on the rigged Super Bowl backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis. Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series along with one other man believed to be a close friend. Goodes an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football Leagues Park Avenue headquarters had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sundays Super Bowl featuring the two teams. However Goodes went off-script in Minneapolis and was physically removed from the premises by security staff but not before publicly condemning the NFL as totally corrupt and claiming the Super Bowl is fixed. Telling reporters that he is a football fan first and foremost and a lawyer second Goodes said Football in America in 2018 doesnt need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesnt pass the sniff test. I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I cant stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me wont allow it. Football in America wont recover from this. Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an gangland-style execution in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story. According to Goodes the NFL have organized a rigged game that will earn maximum revenue for the league and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth. This is the biggest scam in sports history Goodes said in Minneapolis according to reports. The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out. How do I know its scripted? Ive read the damn thing. You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes cant be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises so they dont care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesnt matter to the franchise owners. It doesnt matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here. The sad thing is that its legal. Can you believe that? Its legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me. Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as entertainment Goodes said The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine. The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as entertainment rather than sport as well as incorporate itself as a single entity instead of the 32 separate franchises they would want you to believe. In a 2004 lawsuit the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity providing entertainment in the marketplace and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws. The only other sport that occupies this legal position is the WWE. How are games rigged? According to Goodes the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system. Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesnt happen. Are they that good? Hell no theyre not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every single game. So how is it fixed? Refs manipulate who wins for the overall benefit of the NFL. The NFL splits its revenue between teams so do the players care? Im telling you now they dont care. What player would care if they get an extra $5 million when the salary cap goes up thanks to more revenues built on scripted outcomes? The players have an awareness about it and the refs also make penalty calls in key situations to manipulate the score and outcomes. How come zero players call out the refs? How come zero coaches call out the refs despite the outrageous calls that change the results of games? Everyone is on the same side thats why. These NFL refs are part-time employees of the NFL. They sign the tightest contracts you will ever see in your life. They work for the league period. They are bound by NFL mandated gag orders. They cant open their mouth and say a single word to the media or their ass is toast. Why doesnt anyone speak out? According to Goodes people do speak out. But nobody wants to hear. Remember the Harbaugh Bowl? Arthur Blank the Atlanta Falcons owner admitted the results were fixed. It is predetermined that these two teams would be here I was my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl. And the NFL admitted it themselves in court. We are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. Were exempt. Super Bowl LII will be the 52nd Super Bowl and the 48th modern-era NFL championship game contested between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday.,,,0,0,,

For some it was the era of Camelot and the expectations of idyllic principles and visionary achievements yet for others it was the murky waters on the night of July 18th 1969 and the cowardly act of running away and the ensuing cover-up that followed. On Tuesday night another Kennedy made his debut to the American people following President Trumps triumphant address to the nation. The young freckled face redhead had all the family mannerisms of the famous family clan especially that of his grandfather Robert F. Kennedy however the question that quickly came to mind is which Kennedy will eventually emerge the one who stared down the Russians during the Cuban missile crisis or the one who allowed a young girl to drown suffocating slowly for over 40-minutes before her air-pocket finally gave out. Joe Kennedy was tasked with giving the traditional Democratic response standing on a makeshift stage inside a garage type enclosure and browning his grandfathers casual dress code the 37-year old began to speak with that same Bostonian twang stating boldly; Build a wall and my generation will tear it down! Referencing of course the presidents promise to build a big beautiful border wall. Kennedy continued: Bullies may land a punch. They might leave a mark. But they have never not once in the history of our United States managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future. It was indeed a powerful Kennedy type speech with all the drama and theatrics of a young Barack Obama and just as disingenuous. In that when it comes to border security the Kennedy Compound boasts quite an impressive BORDER WALL of its own surrounding the entire estate which makes this Joe perhaps more aligned with Uncle Teddy then with Uncle Jack. Do you believe theyll ever be another Kennedy in the White House? And if so who? Tell is what you think in the comments below. Comments comments,,,0,0,,

About 5 million U.S. adults and 1 million U.S. children use homeopathy every year and the remedies are known to be generally safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions according to the U.S. National Institutes of Healths National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.1 Yet if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues on its latest crusade this natural health modality may soon be much harder to come by. In a draft guidance document released in December 2017 the FDA takes aim at homeopathic remedies or as they put it drug products labeled as homeopathic.23 In a reversal of a long-standing decision to treat homeopathic remedies differently from other drugs the FDA has now labeled virtually all of these products as new drugs that are subject to FDA enforcement action at any time.

In a written response to Trumps speech Faiz Shakir the ACLUs national political director said: Tonight President Trump said the word America more than 80 times in his speech. Yet after a divisive first year we hear and feel how exclusionary that America is with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities. The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities both in the courts and at the polls. In particular the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force. We are at this crossroads because of the Presidents deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric. We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let Americas Dreamers be deported.

A group of liberal Hollywood celebrities are threatening a massive all-round Hollywood strike unless Donald Trump resigns. Describing Hollywood as the base of the entire modern American culture the group also claims to be speaking on behalf of all of humanity. Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us not the other way around a spokesperson for the group told The New York Times. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops. Spinzon reports: Rosie ODonnell Debra Messing Ed Asner and Michael Shannon are among the dozens of artists entertainers and activists who have attached their names to an effort calling for a month-long protest to stop President-elect Donald Trump. No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America! reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. Donald Trump the President-elect is assembling a regime of grave danger the ad says. Millions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety fear and disgust. Our anguish is right and just. Our anger must now become massive resistance before Donald Trump is inaugurated and has the full reins of power in his hands. Other Hollywood celebrities who have also joined the campaign however are calling for an all-out strike that would span the entire movie industry in the hopes that such a move would urge the President-elect to resign from his position as the newly elected President of the United States. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops a spokesperson for the Refuse Racism group told The New York Times. Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us not the other way around. Asked to elaborate on why the group is targeting Hollywood out of all the industries in the country as their bargaining chip the spokesperson argued that Hollywood is simply put the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country so to speak the glue thats holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down right? Well thats exactly whats going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while were on the subject between you and me nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing but this is a necessary move. Besides its not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasnt ventured into movies in his day right? So hell understand firsthand whats going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So in effect its not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; its the people of America who are going to make him do it because the Gods honest truth is without Hollywood there is no America. Its like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront it just becomes pointless the spokesperson concluded. SOURCE: topalertnews,,,0,0,,

The Bermuda Triangle Bermuda Triangle does not need any introduction. If you ever read anything upon the biggest unsolved mysteries in the world I am sure Bermuda Triangle wouldve topped that list! It is famous for sucking in (mysteriously) anything and everything that comes in its area. Right from flights to ships everything has lost its way in here. But what happened recently might just be the curse breaker for this scary place. 2. The Reappeared Ship Apparently something happened that this Triangle is not really known for. A ship that was lost recently reappeared magically behind the winds within the waves. Well this is no joke my friends. On a very serious note a ship just reappeared mysteriously out of nowhere. 3. Was First Spotted On The Cuban Coast Guard announced that they had intercepted an unmanned ship heading for the island which is presumed to be the SS Cotopaxi a tramp steamer which vanished in December 1925 and has since been connected to the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. See told yll I was serious! This ship was first spotted on May 16 near a restricted military zone west of Havana by the Cuban authorities! They made many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the crew and finally mobilized three patrol boats to intercept it. 4. When It First Vanished On 29 November 1925 the SS Cotopaxi departed Charleston South Carolina and headed towards Havana Cuba. The ship had a crew of 32 men under the command of Captain W. J. Meyer and was carrying a cargo of 2340 tons of coal. It was reported missing two days later and was unheard of for almost 90 years. When the ship was first lost no one mustve imagined that itll reappear 90 years later in such condition. But to everyones surprise it did! 5. The Investigation The Vice President of Council of Ministers General Abelardo Colome announced that the Cuban authorities were going to conduct a thorough investigation to elucidate the mystery of the ships disappearance and reappearance. After this incident the scientists are already excited about the new pattern of research theyll conduct in the area. Lets wait an watch if some more missing things resurface back in this area! Hopefully! Source: http://indiantribe.us Sponsored,,,0,0,,

Action Alert! The policy comes in the form of a guidance document which lays out the FDAs current position on the regulation of homeopathic drugs. In the guidance the FDA says: Any homeopathic drug that has not been considered generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/E) is considered a new drug; FDA has not determined that any homeopathic drugs are GRAS/E; A new drug cannot be marketed unless it goes through the FDAs approval process; No homeopathic drugs have gone through FDA approval nor can any producer afford to take them through the approval process. Thats right: in one fell swoop the FDA has declared that virtually every single homeopathic drug on the market is being sold illegally. The guidance explains that the agency will apply a risk-based regulatory approach that will prioritize enforcement actions against: products with reported safety concerns; products that contain or claim to contain ingredients associated with potentially significant safety concerns e.g. belladonna or strychnine; products for routes of administration other than oral and topical e.g. injectable and ophthalmic products; products intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of serious and/or life-threatening diseases and conditions e.g. cancer heart disease and opioid addition; products for vulnerable populations e.g. children; and products that are deemed adulterated under FDC Act 501 e.g. do not meet standards of quality strength or purity as required under the law. The FDA also says that it recognizes that many homeopathic drugs fall outside of these categories and does not intend to take action against such products at this time but the writing is on the wall. If it wants to the FDA could go after any homeopathic drug currently on the market. Is this level of regulatory scrutiny necessary? No. Although prior to the release of FDAs guidance document homeopathic drugs did not need to go through the New Drug Approval process they underwent a different kind of pre-market approval. Homeopathic drugs traditionally required a monograph from the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS) which involves clinical verification of the efficacy of the substance. FDAs process started two years ago when the agency held a public hearing to evaluate its enforcement policies for homeopathic products. We suspected the agency was planning to tighten its grip on homeopathy which after all competes with the pharmaceutical drugs that fund the FDA. We cannot let the FDA eliminate consumer access to homeopathy. Action Alert! Write to the FDA and tell them that previous rules were sufficient to regulate homeopathic products and this new proposal threatens the future of homeopathy. Please send your message immediately.

We are sorry for the confusion. We have cut ties with the source that provided the information to us. Dailyeb is the site. Please share this so people are informed of this update. Thank you. We will keep the story posted below. Again we apologize for the inconvenience and confusion. End of update Its time to get seriously concerned about the mindset of the liberals. College kids pledge to remove genitals if Trump builds the wall. It was previously reported that 2% of the students at the University of Cal would remove their penis if Trump builds the wall. Now students at the University of Washington have joined the fray. Four of their students have promised to remove part of their reproductive anatomy if the wall is built. Trent Griliphaen a sophomore at Washington is inspired by the movement at the University of California. He went on to say that he thinks that Trumps construction of the wall is just an extension of his penis and an expression of Patriarchal rape culture. Really by building the wall we are raping the Mexican people and I am no longer willing to be a perpetrator of rape culture. If I remove my penis I am making a statement that I reject this mentality. Griliphaen was the first student at the University of Washington to embrace this movement. He already has 3 fellow students who have his back. Thats right three others are ready to castrate themselves in public as a show of disapproval. I heard about what was happening in California and new that this kind of movement could gain traction up here we are a progressive state. I kind of feel guilty Im removing my penis but one of the other guys is going to castrate himself and hes even considering taking off a couple of fingers Griliphaen said. College Kids Pledge to Remove Genitals if Trump Builds the Wall Yep this is real. An actual person really said this stuff. And 3 real people have his back. This is absolutely insane.

These people have reached a whole new level of absurdity. Lets laugh at them. Or better yet lets call and email them. Anyone know phone numbers/email addresses? The American Civil Liberties Union note the word American in its title complained Tuesday night about President Trumps repeated use of the word America in his State of the Union speech. In a written response to Trumps speech Faiz Shakir (this is the problem right here) the ACLUs national political director said: Tonight President Trump said the word America more than 80 times in his speech. Yet after a divisive first year we hear and feel how exclusionary that America is with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities. The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities both in the courts and at the polls. In particular the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force. We are at this crossroads because of the Presidents deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric. We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let Americas Dreamers be deported. President Trump told the nation Monday night that Congress will be voting on an immigration reform package over the next few weeks and he outlined the four pillars of his fair compromise plan:. www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/aclu-complains-trump-said-america-more-80-times-his-speech-its-exclusionary Mike,,,0,0,,

Describing Hollywood as the base of the entire modern American culture the group also claims to be speaking on behalf of all of humanity. loading... Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us not the other way around a spokesperson for the group told The New York Times. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops. Spinzon reports: Rosie ODonnell Debra Messing Ed Asner and Michael Shannon are among the dozens of artists entertainers and activists who have attached their names to an effort calling for a month-long protest to stop President-elect Donald Trump. No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America! reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. Donald Trump the President-elect is assembling a regime of grave danger the ad says. Millions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety fear and disgust. Our anguish is right and just. Our anger must now become massive resistance before Donald Trump is inaugurated and has the full reins of power in his hands. Other Hollywood celebrities who have also joined the campaign however are calling for an all-out strike that would span the entire movie industry in the hopes that such a move would urge the President-elect to resign from his position as the newly elected President of the United States. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops a spokesperson for the Refuse Racism group told The New York Times. Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us not the other way around. Asked to elaborate on why the group is targeting Hollywood out of all the industries in the country as their bargaining chip the spokesperson argued that Hollywood is simply put the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country so to speak the glue thats holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down right? Well thats exactly whats going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while were on the subject between you and me nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing but this is a necessary move. Besides its not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasnt ventured into movies in his day right? So hell understand firsthand whats going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So in effect its not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; its the people of America who are going to make him do it because the Gods honest truth is without Hollywood there is no America. Its like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront it just becomes pointless the spokesperson concluded. loading... H/T,,,0,0,,

The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities. Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II. A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease. The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation. The submarine was identified as the UX-791 a unique experimental German submarine based on the U-1200 model and known to have participated in the Battle of the St. Lawrence. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coast. Professor Mark Carpenter who leads the team of archaeologists believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River all the way to the Great Lakes where it intended to disturb the American economy. A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81) an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate. We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes Professor Carpenter told reporters.This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943 and the reported Battle of Niagara Falls which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear. The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years but once completed the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.,,,0,0,,

They are as crooked as a football bat. Also it seems that everyone that comes into contact with them seems to always die under mysterious circumstances. Its no secret that the Clinton Foundation has been facing credible reports of robbing impoverished Haitians who were devastated by Hurricane Hanna in 2008 through their foundation. Haitians have been protesting for years outside of the Clinton Foundation offices over the theft of money that was donated by individuals and businesses to the Clinton Foundation that never made it to the poorest of the poor. One man was set to testify against the Clinton Foundation next week. That man was 50 year old former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein. He was found dead in his Miami home with a gunshot to the head thats been ruled a suicide by the Miami-Dades medical examiner records supervisor. (Think Vince Foster) Klaus Eberwein a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week has been found dead in Miami. He was 50. Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors. Eberwein who had acknowledged his life was in danger was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundations activities in the Caribbean island where he served as director general of the governments economic development agency Fonds dassistance conomique et social for three years. According to Eberwein a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% or $5.4 billion was funneled to non-Haitian organizations. The Clinton Foundation they are criminals they are thieves they are liars they are a disgrace Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year. The former director general of Haiti who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti Muncheez and even has a pizza the Klaus Special named after him. According to the Haiti Libre newspaper Eberwein was said to be in good spirits with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide. Its really shocking said Muncheezs owner Gilbert Bailly. We grew up together; he was like family. Americans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016 former Senate President of Haiti Bernard Sansaricq shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clintons dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind and to expose the crimes of the Clintons who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.

President Trump told the nation Monday night that Congress will be voting on an immigration reform package over the next few weeks and he outlined the four pillars of his fair compromise plan: The four pillars include a path to citizenship for 1.8 million dreamers if they meet education and work requirements and demostrate good moral character; a fully secure border including a wall in places and hiring more border patrol agents; an end to the random diversity visa lottery and adoption of a merit-based system; and an end to chain migration by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. (Democrats offered scattered boos to the last item.) These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise and one that will create a safe modern and lawful immigration system Trump said. For over 30 years Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together set politics aside and finally get the job done.,,,0,0,,

But during the actual speech Kennedy said one thing that quickly turned him into Americas biggest hypocrite. Build a wall and my generation will tear it down Kennedy stated boldly. Well hed have to start with his own estate first. Joe Kennedys Palm Beach Florida mansion now on the market has sprawling walls surrounding the property. Looks exactly like the big beautiful wall Trump wants to build around America. Now isnt that funny Kennedy owns a wall thats an ideal border wall yet trashes the president for wanting to build a wall that looks like the one Kennedy has. Can you get any more hypocritical? Even more interesting is that this estate is only six miles from President Trumps Mar-a-Lago or the Winter White House. In addition the history surrounding the Kennedy familys protection is quite steep famed six-acre Kennedy compound with three homes on the Hyannis Port waterfront often had extra layers of police protection due to tourist curiosity surrounding the Kennedys perhaps they wanted the illegals off their property? Its unclear if these walls and border protections were morally reprehensible in the eyes of the 37-year-old Kennedy. He also added We choose the thousands of American communities whose roads arent paved with power and privilege but with honest effort good faith and the resolve to build something better for their kids. Building something better apparently doesnt include walls. SHARE on Facebook and Twitter if youre ready to build the wall! #,,,0,0,,

Federal debt skyrocketed under Obama. He was printing money by the end of his reign. This is unheard of in our history. He ran the country like a banana republic said Denzel Washington at a New York screening of his new film the legal drama Roman J. Israel Esq. Asked by a reporter whether his information about Obama was correct Denzel Washington confirmed that it was absolutely correct. He also criticized mainstream media for attempting to turn Obama into a kind of idol. Why arent they discussing the facts? They think we are too stupid to understand the metrics? Denzel Washington said explaining that he had seen a segment about Obamas legacy that blew my mind and left me raging. There were more ready-and-willing workers out of the labor force than ever before by the time that guy left office. Obama blew it for America big time and now they are trying to portray him as some kind of idol? The number of people in America on food stamps more than tripled in his second term. More than tripled! Average family income went down dramatically. Home ownership rates across America went down the toilet. Obama and his cronies sold us out. Real American workers have never had less of a share of the economy. The Equalizer actor also explained that while many of his Hollywood peers were groomed by the Obamas with invitations to parties in the White House black-tie balls and barbecues on the lawn he wasnt extended the same treatment. He knew I was very suspect about him. I have always been very suspect about him. Where did he come from? What was he really doing before running for office? His history sure isnt what they say. Did he go to Columbia? Who put him in power? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about Obama and his colleagues. Once upon a time this is what investigative journalists at the big newspapers would be determined to find out. Now you have all been co-opted. You defend the crooks. -Wow..

Advertisement story continues below If the Democrats had won the election we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it! said Denzel Washington at a press conference in New York.

Israel Esq. The nomination marks the eighth time Washington has been nominated in the best actor category making him the most-nominated African-American actor of all time. Asked by a reporter if he was sure the memo released by Congress on Friday was reliable Denzil Washington said Hell yeah its reliable. We dont need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly whats happened here. We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. You guys cant see what is wrong with this? Youre kidding me The Equalizer actor said before adding Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about the Democratic Party. I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But youve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided a war with Russia and we avoided the creation of an Orwellian police state. Roman J. Israel Esq. is available digitally now with the Blu-ray and DVD hitting shelves Feb. 13.,,,0,0,,

How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about the Democratic Party. I grew up a Democrat. I get it.

Calling the word divisive Faiz Shakir the ACLUs national political director said the presidents repeated use of our nations name was harmful to vulnerable communities. Tonight President Trump said the word America more than 80 times in his speech the ACLU said in a statement posted to its website (https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-trumps-america-exclusionary). Yet after a divisive first year we hear and feel how exclusionary that America is with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities. The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities both in the courts and at the polls. In particular the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force the statement continued. We are at this crossroads because of the Presidents deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric. We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let Americas Dreamers be deported. The organization which has been a leader in efforts to prevent the deportation of illegal immigrants has stepped up their fight against law enforcement and federal immigration agencies during the course of the past year. Some mainstream news agencies have also come under fire since Trumps Tuesday night address for condemning traditional American values referenced by the president. Church family police military the national anthem Trump trying to call on all the tropes of 1950s-era nationalism. The goal of this speech appears to be to force the normalization of Trump on the terms of the bygone era his supporters are nostalgic for MSNBCs Joy Reid tweeted in response to the presidents speech (https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/958528313563254784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.infowars.com%2Faclu-attacks-trump-sotu-speech-used-word-america-over-80-times%2F). Reids comments quickly resulted in a wave of backlash from Conservatives who called her comments sick and disrespectful. Do you seriously consider Church family police military the national anthem to be terms of a bygone era? Forbes columnist Joseph Steinberg tweeted in response to Reids comment. Since when are things like Church & family bygone era? You liberals are some sick ungodly anti-family (husband & wife) individuals another Twitter user Patricia Dickson tweeted to Reid in response. So you hate Church family policy and military? How much more disrespectful can you be? yet another Twitter user Ben Jammin replied to Reid. Despite the ACLUs claims that the presidents words during his State of the Union address were divisive Trump administration officials have called on media outlets to focus on the presidents actual words during his first ever state address. Tonight I am extending an open hard to work with members of both parties Democrats and Republicans to protect our citizens of every background color religion and creed Trump said. My duty and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber is to defend Americans to protect their safety their families their communities and their right to the American Dream Trump added.

Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an gangland-style execution hours after blowing the whistle on the rigged Super Bowl backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis. Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series along with one other man believed to be a close friend. Goodes an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football Leagues Park Avenue headquarters had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sundays Super Bowl featuring the two teams. However Goodes went off-script in Minneapolis and was physically removed from the premises by security staff but not before publicly condemning the NFL as totally corrupt and claiming the Super Bowl is fixed. Telling reporters that he is a football fan first and foremost and a lawyer second Goodes said Football in America in 2018 doesnt need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesnt pass the sniff test. I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I cant stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me wont allow it. Football in America wont recover from this.

A female reporter with a German accent asked President Trump who had just taken his seat Why are you smiling so broadly like the cat that got the cream? Before President Trump could answer U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen seated on the far left in the photo said He is smiling because he just told George Soros to go to hell. Mainstream media from around the world reported on George Soros speech at Davos which he dedicated entirely to criticizing President Trump. Attempting to convince the world that Trumps presidency is a danger to the world. According to the notorious globalist billionaire the survival of humanity depends on Trump being impeached in the next twelve months. Not only the survival of Open Society but the survival of our entire civilization is at stake said Soros. But Soross speech didnt go down well at Davos. Expecting the audience to be on his side Soros was dismayed when he was ignored and President Trump received something close to a heros welcome according to the New York Post. Even the Washington Post was unable to spin the event into a negative Trump story admitting that the president managed to win at Davos. And the reason is simple: Its hard to argue with success. Sustained economic growth (a much improved 2.6 percent GDP for the fourth quarter and thats before the epic tax cuts kick in) signs of higher wage growth (many companies are now handing out bonus checks to workers for the first time since 2007) and a roaring stock market (with the Dow heading close to 30000) are cold hard facts that cannot be argued with. Even people who claim to despise Trump are finding a silver lining in the orange-tinted cloud. This is all bad news for Soros the octogenarian billionaire who recently pumped $18 billion into leftist causes around the world. While much of the money Soros spends through his Open Society Foundation has gone to destabilizing democracy in Eastern Europe and more recently to crashing economies and devastating developing nations around the globe he has now shifted his focus he said and will spend much of his money taking on President Trump directly in America. Was Soros surprised by the muted response to his speech at Davos? The fact Soros attempted to gain a coveted one-on-one meeting with Trump after delivering such a negative speech should come as no surprise. This is the man who claims he is a God and that normal rules do not apply to him. President Trumps sharp words to George Soros were all that he deserved. In contrast to Soross dismal speech Trumps speech went down a storm. Informing the audience that Washington will no longer turn a blind eye to predatory trade policies of other countries he also made a point to note America first does not mean America alone. When the United States grows so does the world. Besides George Soros who could possibly argue with that?,,,0,0,,

By Kit Daniels NewsWars.com Wednesday January 31 2018 Was the safety signals for the train carrying GOP leaders outside Charlottesville Va. hacked to ensure the train would crash or was the incident completely accidental? Was the Deep State trying to send a message to globalist Republicans to get back in line to jump off the Trump train after the presidents unifying message during the State of the Union? Of course the train crash might have been a complete accident but nevertheless heres some of the weird circumstances surrounding it so far. The timing and location: The train was carrying GOP leaders including globalists such as Paul Ryan who had previously tried to block Trumps agenda. Interestingly enough before the crash columnist Michael Goodwin said the GOP was now Trumps party and that the president was teaching Republicans how to fight and win. The evidence is everywhere every day and it was on vivid display [at the State of the Union] he wrote. The president remains in a fighting mood determined to keep punching his way forward. And remember Trumps agenda is often called the Trump Train and after the State of the Union it appears that more and more Republican lawmakers are jumping on board. So was the stalled dump truck crash meant to send a warning to lawmakers to block Trumps agenda? The crash of course happened the morning after Trumps address and it happened outside Charlottesville Virginia the site of the notorious Unite the Right rally which the mainstream media tried to link to the president. And heres another interesting factoid which likely means nothing but its interesting nonetheless: the train was a charter train but it was operating on the Amtrak Cardinal route which was the successor to the George Washington train that provided passenger service from 1932 to around 1971 when Amtrak took over.

Here are the highlights From Fox News: Jay-Z went home from the Grammys empty-handed even though he was the most-nominated artist of the night capping off a bad weekend for the rapper that included a highly publicized feud with President Trump. [] Jay-Z began the music awards weekend with an interview on CNN during which he criticized Trumps alleged shole countries remark. He also said lower unemployment for the countrys African-American population is not enough when people in power are still mistreating minorities and others. Its not about money at the end of the day he said on The Van Jones Show. Money doesnt equate to happiness. It doesnt. Thats missing the whole point. You treat people like human beings. Thats the main point. The comments sparked a response from Trump who tweeted: Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!

The ACLUs national political director Faiz Shakir wrote a statement about the State of the Union in which he counted the number of times President Trump said the word America. From Shakirs statement: Tonight President Trump said the word America more than 80 times in his speech. Yet after a divisive first year we hear and feel how exclusionary that America is with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities. The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities both in the courts and at the polls. In particular the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force. We are at this crossroads because of the presidents deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric. We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let Americas Dreamers be deported. During his State of the Union speech on Monday night President Trump said that Congress will soon be voting to pass immigration reform packages. Trump specifically mentioned four pillars which are fundamental components of what he calls a fair compromise concerning immigration reform. The ACLU clearly wasnt impressed and claimed these pillars were deeply destructive and naive. CNS News reports: The four pillars include a path to citizenship for 1.8 million dreamers if they meet education and work requirements and demonstrate good moral character; a fully secure border including a wall in places and hiring more border patrol agents; an end to the random diversity visa lottery and adoption of a merit-based system; and an end to chain migration by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. (Democrats offered scattered boos to the last item.) These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise and one that will create a safe modern and lawful immigration system Trump said. For over 30 years Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together set politics aside and finally get the job done. According to the ACLU part of Trumps divisive rhetoric is his use of the term American which is somehow a bad thing. Of course Shakir could have made better use of his time than watching the State of the Union over again counting each time the President said the word American. For example he could write a comprehensive response to the Presidents pillars that actually address what he thinks is wrong with the proposals besides coping out with vague mentions of nativity and divisiveness. Rather than a reasonable argument however Shakir was perfectly content with two paragraphs more concerned with obsessive compulsive counting and infantile name calling than forming an actual counter-argument to the Presidents plan for immigration reform.

Mueller III into the Trump campaigns false ties to Russia. He has emerged as a visible nemesis of Americans appearing almost daily on television to discuss the various fake investigations of President Trump. Little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and Clapper! President Trump tweeted referring to former James B. Comey the former F.B.I. director; Senator Mark Warner Democrat of Virginia; John O. Brennan the former C.I.A. director; and James R. Clapper Jr. the former director of national intelligence. Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped! Coincidentally Adam Schiffs sister is the estranged wife of globalist George Soros son. Billionaire George Soross son Robert and his estranged wife Melissa Schiff are at risk of forfeiting their entire art collection including pieces by Jeff Koons and Christopher Wool if they cant agree on its value his lawyer said. The former couple were in Manhattan Supreme Court Wednesday for the opening day of their $350 million divorce trial. Soros attorney Alan Feigenbaum said their prenuptial agreement states that if the parties cannot agree on a valueproperty should be sold. But Schiffs lawyer Bernard Clair disputed that interpretation. He argued that an appeals court ruled in April that the prenup does not address the disposition of marital art. Soros who until recently ran his fathers $28 billion investment management firm wants to sell off their collection while Schiff wants to keep selected pieces. Theyre also fighting over a $5.85 million Rhinebeck farm which Schiff testified that she loves more than anything. Soros filed for divorce from his wife of 22 years in 2014 after an affair with a nude model.,,,0,0,,

A group of liberal Hollywood celebrities are threatening a massive all-round Hollywood strike unless Donald Trump resigns. Describing Hollywood as the base of the entire modern American culture the group also claims to be speaking on behalf of all of humanity. Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us not the other way around a spokesperson for the group told The New York Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops. Spinzon reports: Rosie ODonnell Debra Messing Ed Asner and Michael Shannon are among the dozens of artists entertainers and activists who have attached their names to an effort calling for a month-long protest to stop President-elect Donald Trump. No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America! reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. Donald Trump the President-elect is assembling a regime of grave danger the ad says. Millions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety fear and disgust. Our anguish is right and just. Our anger must now become massive resistance before Donald Trump is inaugurated and has the full reins of power in his hands. Other Hollywood celebrities who have also joined the campaign however are calling for an all-out strike that would span the entire movie industry in the hopes that such a move would urge the President-elect to resign from his position as the newly elected President of the United States. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops a spokesperson for the Refuse Racism group told The New York Times. Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us not the other way around. Asked to elaborate on why the group is targeting Hollywood out of all the industries in the country as their bargaining chip the spokesperson argued that Hollywood is simply put the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country so to speak the glue thats holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down right? Well thats exactly whats going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while were on the subject between you and me nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing but this is a necessary move. Besides its not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasnt ventured into movies in his day right? So hell understand firsthand whats going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So in effect its not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; its the people of America who are going to make him do it because the Gods honest truth is without Hollywood there is no America. Its like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront it just becomes pointless the spokesperson concluded.,,,0,0,,

The Federal Bureau of Investigation suspected 54-year old Dave Murray an employee of the Harris County Morgue of being implicated in an organ trafficking network. Investigating several reports of missing organs and body parts dozens of agents raided his residence this morning hoping to find evidence of his involvement in the crimes. What they found on the site was a lot more disturbing than what they expected as the FBI spokesman Andy Ramirez described the scene in an interview with WNTV-4. There were shelves everywhere filled with hundreds of glass jars. Each of them contained a penis floating in formalin. According to Agent Ramirez the accused rapidly confessed everything as soon as he was arrested. He explained in great detail how he had been cutting off dead mens genital organs and collecting them for more than ten years. It took the FBI more than seven hours to gather all the organs and other pieces of evidence that were found on the site. A dozen federal agents of the FBIs Evidence Response Team were still identifying collecting and packing jars more than six hours after their arrival on the site. A total of 53 criminal charges have already been filed against Mr. Murray and hundreds more could be filed over the next few days. An anonymous FBI source told WNTV-4 that the number of charges could reach over 3000. Dave Murray will remain in custody for the moment as a psychiatric evaluation has been ordered to determine if hes fit to stand a trial. If he is considered fit he should appear in court in October for the beginning of the procedures. SOURCE : World News24,,,0,0,,

Julia Roberts was speaking on the New York set of her new film as principal photography began on the drama Ben Is Back. Michelle Obama paid a visit to the film production while in the vicinity and Julia Roberts agreed to meet her however she opened up about the differences between Americas most recent First Ladies as soon as Michelle left the set. Melania has her priorities straight and she is a great example for our young women Julia Roberts said. Michelle? Talk about a wolf in sheepskin. The news comes days after Julia Roberts slammed Celine Dion for criticizing the POTUS and stating that she hates America. I cant even look at an American flag anymore. I hate this country Canadian Celine Dion said while complaining about the Trump presidency. Youre wrong Celine Julia Roberts fired back. The America we know and love was destroyed by Obama and his disastrous presidency. If you disagree you can always go back to your own country. In fact perhaps you really should. Celine Dion was one of dozens of liberal celebrities who threatened to leave the United States and return to their homelands if America elected Donald Trump as president. So far a grand total of zero of these liberal celebrities have followed through with their threat to leave. The sheer hypocrisy makes it hard to believe they really feel as strongly as they claim about Trump. Its all hot air and virtue signaling from the celebrity contingent on the left.

Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an gangland-style execution hours after blowing the whistle on the rigged Super Bowl backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis. Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series along with one other man believed to be a close friend. Goodes an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football Leagues Park Avenue headquarters had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sundays Super Bowl featuring the two teams. However Goodes went off-script in Minneapolis and was physically removed from the premises by security staff but not before publicly condemning the NFL as totally corrupt and claiming the Super Bowl is fixed. Telling reporters that he is a football fan first and foremost and a lawyer second Goodes said Football in America in 2018 doesnt need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesnt pass the sniff test. I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I cant stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me wont allow it. Football in America wont recover from this. Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an gangland-style execution in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story. According to Goodes the NFL have organized a rigged game that will earn maximum revenue for the league and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth. This is the biggest scam in sports history Goodes said in Minneapolis according to reports. The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out. How do I know its scripted? Ive read the damn thing. You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes cant be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises so they dont care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesnt matter to the franchise owners. It doesnt matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here. The sad thing is that its legal. Can you believe that? Its legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me. Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as entertainment Goodes said The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine. The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as entertainment rather than sport as well as incorporate itself as a single entity instead of the 32 separate franchises they would want you to believe. In a 2004 lawsuit the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity providing entertainment in the marketplace and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws. The only other sport that occupies this legal position is the WWE. How are games rigged? According to Goodes the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system. Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesnt happen. Are they that good? Hell no theyre not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every single game. So how is it fixed? Refs manipulate who wins for the overall benefit of the NFL. The NFL splits its revenue between teams so do the players care? Im telling you now they dont care. What player would care if they get an extra $5 million when the salary cap goes up thanks to more revenues built on scripted outcomes? The players have an awareness about it and the refs also make penalty calls in key situations to manipulate the score and outcomes. How come zero players call out the refs? How come zero coaches call out the refs despite the outrageous calls that change the results of games? Everyone is on the same side thats why. First guy to congratulate Brady? Number 34. What a teammate! pic.twitter.com/azXq3qgN43 OurState_CSU (@OurStateCSU) January 21 2018 These NFL refs are part-time employees of the NFL. They sign the tightest contracts you will ever see in your life. They work for the league period. They are bound by NFL mandated gag orders. They cant open their mouth and say a single word to the media or their ass is toast. Why doesnt anyone speak out? According to Goodes people do speak out. But nobody wants to hear. Remember the Harbaugh Bowl? Arthur Blank the Atlanta Falcons owner admitted the results were fixed. It is predetermined that these two teams would be here I was my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl. And the NFL admitted it themselves in court. We are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. Were exempt. Super Bowl LII will be the 52nd Super Bowl and the 48th modern-era NFL championship game contested between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday.,,,0,0,,

Action Alert! The policy comes in the form of a guidance document which lays out the FDAs current position on the regulation of homeopathic drugs. In the guidance the FDA says: Any homeopathic drug that has not been considered generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/E) is considered a new drug; FDA has not determined that any homeopathic drugs are GRAS/E; A new drug cannot be marketed unless it goes through the FDAs approval process; No homeopathic drugs have gone through FDA approval nor can any producer afford to take them through the approval process. Thats right: in one fell swoop the FDA has declared that virtually every single homeopathic drug on the market is being sold illegally. The guidance explains that the agency will apply a risk-based regulatory approach that will prioritize enforcement actions against: products with reported safety concerns; products that contain or claim to contain ingredients associated with potentially significant safety concerns e.g. belladonna or strychnine; products for routes of administration other than oral and topical e.g. injectable and ophthalmic products; products intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of serious and/or life-threatening diseases and conditions e.g. cancer heart disease and opioid addition; products for vulnerable populations e.g. children; and products that are deemed adulterated under FDC Act 501 e.g. do not meet standards of quality strength or purity as required under the law. The FDA also says that it recognizes that many homeopathic drugs fall outside of these categories and does not intend to take action against such products at this time but the writing is on the wall. If it wants to the FDA could go after any homeopathic drug currently on the market. Is this level of regulatory scrutiny necessary? No. Although prior to the release of FDAs guidance document homeopathic drugs did not need to go through the New Drug Approval process they underwent a different kind of pre-market approval. Homeopathic drugs traditionally required a monograph from the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS) which involves clinical verification of the efficacy of the substance. FDAs process started two years ago when the agency held a public hearing to evaluate its enforcement policies for homeopathic products. We suspected the agency was planning to tighten its grip on homeopathy which after all competes with the pharmaceutical drugs that fund the FDA. We cannot let the FDA eliminate consumer access to homeopathy. Action Alert! Write to the FDA and tell them that previous rules were sufficient to regulate homeopathic products and this new proposal threatens the future of homeopathy.

The team already in a market saturated with Dolphins Bucs and Falcons fans made the unfortunate mistake of drafting developing and hiring almost exclusively black players leaving them vulnerable to the latest round of weve been treated unfairly protests from millionaires. This particular protest unfortunately happened on national TV and pissed off every God-fearing country-loving American who has either had the honor to serve or know someone who did. They might as well have wiped their proverbial asses with the American flag. last week 31 of the 42 men on the Jacksonville roster took a knee during the national anthem. The coaches just stopped paying attention and went on with their game planning while the few patriots who braved the picket lines to make sure someone was there to respect the flag and our veterans stood and sang the song with pride. Jacksonville is a dead stick. Its been obvious for several years now that an expansion franchise there was a bad idea. The front office isnt responding to comment but an insider tells us that the reorganization will allow the team to stay above water while they pitch a move to the now-empty St. Louis market. What they dont understand is that their market isnt the main problem. They could survive as another Cardinals or expansion Browns team if they didnt have the issue with the players. Our insider tells us thats being taken care of as well. The selling power of the team is the organization and equipment. Salaries wont be covered in the bankruptcy. After this season as many as 24 players will be on their own. Karma. Its a wonderful thing.,,,0,0,,

Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us not the other way around a spokesperson for the group told The New York Times. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops. Spinzon reports: Rosie ODonnell Debra Messing Ed Asner and Michael Shannon are among the dozens of artists entertainers and activists who have attached their names to an effort calling for a month-long protest to stop President-elect Donald Trump. No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America! reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. Donald Trump the President-elect is assembling a regime of grave danger the ad says. Millions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety fear and disgust. Our anguish is right and just. Our anger must now become massive resistance before Donald Trump is inaugurated and has the full reins of power in his hands. Other Hollywood celebrities who have also joined the campaign however are calling for an all-out strike that would span the entire movie industry in the hopes that such a move would urge the President-elect to resign from his position as the newly elected President of the United States. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops a spokesperson for the Refuse Racism group told The New York Times. Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us not the other way around. Asked to elaborate on why the group is targeting Hollywood out of all the industries in the country as their bargaining chip the spokesperson argued that Hollywood is simply put the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country so to speak the glue thats holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down right? Well thats exactly whats going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while were on the subject between you and me nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing but this is a necessary move. Besides its not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasnt ventured into movies in his day right? So hell understand firsthand whats going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So in effect its not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; its the people of America who are going to make him do it because the Gods honest truth is without Hollywood there is no America. Its like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront it just becomes pointless the spokesperson concluded.,,,0,0,,
1086,http://www.anh-usa.org/fda-all-homeopathic-drugs-illegal/,https://www.snopes.com/homeopathic-drugs-now-illegal/,2018-02-01,2000.0,false,But not all will be pulled from the market yet. Action Alert! The policy comes in the form of a guidance document which lays out the FDAs current position on the regulation of homeopathic drugs. In the guidance the FDA says: Any homeopathic drug that has not been considered generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/E) is considered a new drug; FDA has not determined that any homeopathic drugs are GRAS/E; A new drug cannot be marketed unless it goes through the FDAs approval process; No homeopathic drugs have gone through FDA approval nor can any producer afford to take them through the approval process. Thats right: in one fell swoop the FDA has declared that virtually every single homeopathic drug on the market is being sold illegally. The guidance explains that the agency will apply a risk-based regulatory approach that will prioritize enforcement actions against: products with reported safety concerns; products that contain or claim to contain ingredients associated with potentially significant safety concerns e.g. belladonna or strychnine; products for routes of administration other than oral and topical e.g. injectable and ophthalmic products; products intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of serious and/or life-threatening diseases and conditions e.g. cancer heart disease and opioid addition; products for vulnerable populations e.g. children; and products that are deemed adulterated under FDC Act 501 e.g. do not meet standards of quality strength or purity as required under the law. The FDA also says that it recognizes that many homeopathic drugs fall outside of these categories and does not intend to take action against such products at this time but the writing is on the wall. If it wants to the FDA could go after any homeopathic drug currently on the market. Is this level of regulatory scrutiny necessary? No. Although prior to the release of FDAs guidance document homeopathic drugs did not need to go through the New Drug Approval process they underwent a different kind of pre-market approval. Homeopathic drugs traditionally required a monograph from the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS) which involves clinical verification of the efficacy of the substance. FDAs process started two years ago when the agency held a public hearing to evaluate its enforcement policies for homeopathic products. We suspected the agency was planning to tighten its grip on homeopathy which after all competes with the pharmaceutical drugs that fund the FDA. We cannot let the FDA eliminate consumer access to homeopathy. Action Alert! Write to the FDA and tell them that previous rules were sufficient to regulate homeopathic products and this new proposal threatens the future of homeopathy.

1087,http://www.beaware.one/2018/01/07/pedophile-priest-with-hiv-who-raped-30-children-found-crucified-outside-church/,https://www.snopes.com/pedophile-priest-crucified/,2018-01-26,394.0,false,A pedophile priest who was found guilty of raping 30 children while infected with HIV but forgiven by the Vatican has been found dead outside his church. Last year Catholic priest Jose Garcia Ataulfo admitted to raping 30 young girls aged between 5 and 10 years old in Oaxaca Southern Mexico. Ataulfo was cleared of any wrong-doing by the church and didnt face any criminal charges despite the fact that he knew he was infected with HIV when he sexually abused all the children he is known to have raped. As part of Pope Franciss more merciful approach to child abusing clergy Ataulfo was relocated to a different church to seek prayer and forgiveness for his sins. Now it seems as though his past has caught up with him after his dead body was found crucified outside his new church in a rural area of Villa Alta. Ataulfo was found tied from a wooden beam that was hanging from a large tree branch by members of his congregation who had arrived for Sunday mass to find the church closed. According to local police he had been beaten before he was crucified and his genitals had been removed and placed in his mouth.He also had hot road tar poured onto the top of his head which appears to have been done as torture after he was hung up but while he was still alive. His robes had been removed and burned on the floor and he had been dressed in rags and had a wooden plaque nailed to his hand that was engraved with the words: I am no man of God I am a demon. I will pay for my crimes in hell. Police believe that he may have been killed by the violent drug gang known as the Knights Templar. The Knights Templar Cartel (Spanish: Los Caballeros Templarios) is a Mexican criminal organization composed of remnants of the defunct La Familia Michoacana drug cartel and are known for their brutal executions. According to local media reports it is thought that Ataulfo may have had a price on his head for his past crimes and the cartel may have been tipped-off as to where he had been relocated to. Speaking to reporters police spokesman Manuel Moreno Rivas said: This looks like the work of a cartel so we wont get any answers on this one. We might as well chalk this case up as a suicide. I dont think anyone will lose any sleep over that will they? We heard what this guy had done to those kids so lets just leave it there. Ataulfo admitted to sexually assaulting well over two dozen children many of whom were indigenous young girls from Oaxaca a state in southern Mexico known for its large indigenous population. The mother of one of the priests victims wrote a letter to The Pope asking to meet with him in Rome to discuss the case but was shunned by the Vatican who declared that the matter is closed. Due to the significant influence that the Catholic Church wields in Mexico the priest didnt face any criminal charges particularly for his crimes in areas populated by indigenous ethnic groups. The report which first appeared on the Spanish-language news site Urgente24.com says the priest was absolved of any wrongdoing by the Archdiocese of Mexico. Earlier this year Pope Francis announced that the church would be reducing penalties for pedophile priests by relocating them to a different church and offering them support rather than punishing them. The Pope said that the controversial measures were designed to create a more merciful church. According to The Daily Mail sexual abuse of minors by priests and the subsequent cover-ups by bishops and other Church officials have been widespread in many countries including the United States. The issue was thrust into the national spotlight in 2002 when the Boston Globe revealed the extent to which the local archdiocese shielded abusive priests from being exposed to the public even though it knew they posed a danger to young parishioners. The Globe expos which detailed abuse cases that numbered in the thousands over a span of several decades inspired other victims to come forward leading to an avalanche of lawsuits and criminal prosecutions. Not only did the floodgates open in the US but the Catholic Church was also forced to confront cases in other countries including Mexico. In 2004 the Vatican re-opened a prior investigation against Marcial Maciel who was accused of sexually abusing minors as well as fathering six children by three different women. Though the allegations spanned decades and the extent of his crimes was known to church officials it was only in 2006 that the Vatican forced Maciel one of its most powerful clergymen to retire from active ministry.

1088,http://www.beaware.one/2018/01/29/nfl-lawyer-who-claimed-super-bowl-is-rigged-found-dead/,https://www.snopes.com/nfl-lawyer-dead/,2018-01-29,588.0,false,An NFL entertainment lawyer who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is rigged. Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an gangland-style execution hours after blowing the whistle on the rigged Super Bowl backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis. Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series along with one other man believed to be a close friend. Goodes an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football Leagues Park Avenue headquarters had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sundays Super Bowl featuring the two teams. However Goodes went off-script in Minneapolis and was physically removed from the premises by security staff but not before publicly condemning the NFL as totally corrupt and claiming the Super Bowl is fixed. Telling reporters that he is a football fan first and foremost and a lawyer second Goodes said Football in America in 2018 doesnt need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesnt pass the sniff test. I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I cant stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me wont allow it. Football in America wont recover from this. Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an gangland-style execution in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story. According to Goodes the NFL have organized a rigged game that will earn maximum revenue for the league and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth. This is the biggest scam in sports history Goodes said in Minneapolis according to reports. The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out. How do I know its scripted? Ive read the damn thing. You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes cant be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises so they dont care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesnt matter to the franchise owners. It doesnt matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here. The sad thing is that its legal. Can you believe that? Its legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me. Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as entertainment Goodes said The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine. The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as entertainment rather than sport as well as incorporate itself as a single entity instead of the 32 separate franchises they would want you to believe. In a 2004 lawsuit the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity providing entertainment in the marketplace and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws. The only other sport that occupies this legal position is the WWE. How are games rigged? According to Goodes the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system. Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesnt happen. Are they that good? Hell no theyre not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every single game. So how is it fixed? Refs manipulate who wins for the overall benefit of the NFL. The NFL splits its revenue between teams so do the players care? Im telling you now they dont care. What player would care if they get an extra $5 million when the salary cap goes up thanks to more revenues built on scripted outcomes? The players have an awareness about it and the refs also make penalty calls in key situations to manipulate the score and outcomes. How come zero players call out the refs? How come zero coaches call out the refs despite the outrageous calls that change the results of games? Everyone is on the same side thats why. First guy to congratulate Brady? Number 34. What a teammate! pic.twitter.com/azXq3qgN43 OurState_CSU (@OurStateCSU) January 21 2018 These NFL refs are part-time employees of the NFL. They sign the tightest contracts you will ever see in your life. They work for the league period. They are bound by NFL mandated gag orders. They cant open their mouth and say a single word to the media or their ass is toast. Why doesnt anyone speak out? According to Goodes people do speak out. But nobody wants to hear. Remember the Harbaugh Bowl? Arthur Blank the Atlanta Falcons owner admitted the results were fixed. It is predetermined that these two teams would be here I was my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl. And the NFL admitted it themselves in court. We are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. Were exempt. Super Bowl LII will be the 52nd Super Bowl and the 48th modern-era NFL championship game contested between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday.

If the Democrats had won the election we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it! said Denzel Washington at a press conference in New York. They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections said Denzil Washington who has just been nominated for an Oscar for his film Roman J. Israel Esq. The nomination marks the eighth time Washington has been nominated in the best actor category making him the most-nominated African-American actor of all time. Asked by a reporter if he was sure the memo released by Congress on Friday was reliable Denzil Washington said Hell yeah its reliable. We dont need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly whats happened here. We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. You guys cant see what is wrong with this? Youre kidding me The Equalizer actor said before adding Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about the Democratic Party. I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But youve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided a war with Russia and we avoided the creation of an Orwellian police state. Roman J. Israel Esq. is available digitally now with the Blu-ray and DVD hitting shelves Feb. 13.

William Smith 28 from Dallas Texas was discovered in the early hours of Tuesday morning decapitated and left outside the front door of a judge who had granted him bail in August. Smith had been arrested last month following complaints from his ex-girlfriend that he had raped her 8-year-old daughter. Following his arrest he was charged with two counts related to child pornography and one count of child molestation. After being charged Smith was held on a $30000 bail which he was able to pay and walked free from the court. The judge granted bail after ruling that Smith didnt pose a threat to the local community. The victims family said they were shocked that her rapist had been allowed to walk free from court. Smith was awaiting trial for his crimes and was awaiting a court date which was due to be scheduled for later this year. According to reports the judge whose name has been withheld was awoken at around 3 am by his barking dog. When he went outside to check he found the decapitated corpse outside his front door with the head left on the steps. Investigating officers described his death as resembling a gangland-style execution. A local resident said of the horrific discovery that finding a headless body was an unusual incident: This is a nice area. This is the kind of thing that usually happens in mob films but not around here. Police say they are currently following leads but have yet to make any arrests for the murder.

Mueller III into the Trump campaigns false ties to Russia. He has emerged as a visible nemesis of Americans appearing almost daily on television to discuss the various fake investigations of President Trump. Little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and Clapper! President Trump tweeted referring to former James B. Comey the former F.B.I. director; Senator Mark Warner Democrat of Virginia; John O. Brennan the former C.I.A. director; and James R. Clapper Jr. the former director of national intelligence. Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped! Coincidentally Adam Schiffs sister is the estranged wife of globalist George Soros son. Billionaire George Soross son Robert and his estranged wife Melissa Schiff are at risk of forfeiting their entire art collection including pieces by Jeff Koons and Christopher Wool if they cant agree on its value his lawyer said. The former couple were in Manhattan Supreme Court Wednesday for the opening day of their $350 million divorce trial. Soros attorney Alan Feigenbaum said their prenuptial agreement states that if the parties cannot agree on a valueproperty should be sold. But Schiffs lawyer Bernard Clair disputed that interpretation. He argued that an appeals court ruled in April that the prenup does not address the disposition of marital art. Soros who until recently ran his fathers $28 billion investment management firm wants to sell off their collection while Schiff wants to keep selected pieces. Theyre also fighting over a $5.85 million Rhinebeck farm which Schiff testified that she loves more than anything. Source: http://50statereport.com,,,0,0,,

He then issued a scathing response to in which he sarcastically said: Whoever translated it for him from Russian did a good job. A spokesperson for Gutierrez 64 however insisted that his walk out was not a political gesture and was based more on scheduling. He was trying to make it to Univision his spokesman said. He watched the last 90 seconds on TV. It was not a protest or anything. He was just trying to get ahead of the crowd. In his scathing statement Gutierrez said he was hopeful but admitted he doesnt see Congress and the President coming to an agreement that prevents the deportation of dreamers. He also slammed Trump for failing to mention the plight of Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria. Luis Gutierrez 64 walked out of Donald Trumps State of the Union Address as Republican congressmen began chanting USA USA. A spokesperson insisted he left so he could make a television appearance on Univision The Chicago native began: Even though I disagreed with almost everything he said for Trump the speech was clear and well-delivered. Whoever translated it for him from Russian did a good job. The Illinois congressman later released a statement criticizing Trumps speech. I was hoping to get through my life without having to witness an outwardly explicitly racist American President but my luck ran out he said Gutierrez who is of Puerto Rican descent continued: I am still hopeful but I dont see this Congress and this President coming to an agreement that prevents the deportation of the Dreamers. The White House agenda is to gut legal immigration in exchange for allowing some of the Dreamers to live here. For those of us who support legal immigration and thats most Democrats and many Republicans it wont fly. And the Dreamers themselves have said they do not want legal status if it comes at the expense of others who will suffer more as part of the bargain. The speech did nothing to bring the pro- and anti-immigrant sides closer together. I was hoping for some sort of apology on Puerto Rico but I heard nothing. Puerto Rico is a metaphor for how this President sees all Latinos and people of color: he does not see us as his equals and he does not see us as fellow human beings. Gutierrez pictured at a January 19 rally said: Even though I disagreed with almost everything he said for Trump the speech was clear and well-delivered. Whoever translated it for him from Russian did a good job President Donald Trump celebrated the incredible progress and extraordinary success that his administration has made in the year since he took office as he began his State of the Union address on Tuesday If you look at how the President has treated Puerto Rico you have to conclude that he just doesnt care and probably thinks of Puerto Rico as just another s***hole country. I was born in 1953 in the U.S. when separate but equal was the law of the land. I am proud of the progress the United States has made as a nation on issues of race gender sexual orientation disabilities and many other areas where we have advanced.

He was 68. In a brief statement the Cuban government alleged that Castro Daz-Balart had been under the care of a group of doctors for some months due to a deep depressive state. As part of his treatment he initially required a regimen of hospitalization and was later followed on an outpatient basis during his social reintegration the notice added. The Cuban-American news agency Mart Noticias noted that the statement from Havana did not provide any details regarding Castro Daz-Balarts method of suicide or the discovery that he had died. The agency cited unnamed sources who had claimed to Mart in the past that Castro-Daz Balart had made a suicide attempt with a gun three months ago and also claimed that he jumped off a high floor of the Personal Security Clinic in Havana where he was being treated. No other outlets appear to have confirmed this information at press time however. Daz-Balart the cousin of Rep. Mario Daz-Balart former Rep. Lincoln Daz-Balart and NBC/Telemundo anchor Jos Daz-Balart was not actively involved in Cuban politics. A scientist by trade at the time of his death he was the vice president of Cubas Academy of Sciences and top-ranking scientist for the State Council. The son of Fidel Castros only wife Mirta Daz-Balart his father kidnapped the younger Daz-Balart at an early age as his mother fled the Cuban Revolution to Madrid. He was raised without his mother who spent decades in Madrid trying to hide her past relationship to Castro and with minimal attention from his dictator father until being sent to study in the Soviet Union. While the Cuban government generally refers to Fidelito as Castros oldest son a man by the name of Jorge ngel Lpez has also made the claim to being the oldest according to Spanish newspaper El Mundo. Throughout his career as a nuclear physicist Daz-Balart led efforts by the communist government to develop nuclear energy and represented Cuba before the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Despite what has been called a miserable childhood Daz-Balart never publicly criticized his father. For his troubles he enjoyed the familys vast wealth and was notably present at lavish parties with Paris Hilton and Naomi Campbell. Fidel Castro had nine known children however creating significant turmoil regarding his estimated $900 million net worth at the time of his death. Despite the fact that by the time of the elder Castros death his life partner Dalia Soto del Valle had largely ostracized Castros children with other women to benefit her five children the Spanish newspaper El Mundo predicted that among the most benefitted by the inheritance would be Fidelito. Yet Sotos five sons Alexis Alexander Antonio Alejandro y ngel were front and center during funeral ceremonies for the dictator in late 2016. At least one of Fidels children Alina Fernndez is a Cuban dissident and has dedicated much of her career to opposing the dictatorship hence her absence. The Miami-based outlet America TeVe suggested at the time that Fidelito had a bad relationship with Dalia that pushed him away from the center of power. Fidelitos death comes just two months before dictator Ral Castro claims he will step down from power. Castro initially claimed he would abscond the top spot in February but he then moved the date up late last year due to the grave effects caused by Hurricane Irma. The election from which all opposition elements have already been removed is scheduled for April 19 the anniversary of the mass murder of Cuban exiles triggered by President John F. Kennedys policy of betrayal at Bay of Pigs. Any of Fidels sons who wish to take their uncles place will have to contend with Rals own stable of heirs: Ral Jr. and Alejandro Debora Mariela and Nilsa Castro Espn. Alejandro Castro Espn once considered a frontrunner has been disqualified from the race. The Miami Herald notes the sudden appointment of Mariela Castro Espn to the Cuban National Assembly however which suddenly makes her eligible. Mariela Castro Espn has made her name as an LGBT rights advocate for a regime that systematically removed LGBT people from society and locked them in concentration camps. Observers have not identified any of the Castros as likely heirs to the presidency however. Current Vice President Miguel Daz-Canel remains the frontrunner in the race. He has expressed a desire to keep the Castro family in power and openly stated that his government is taking all steps to discredit the opposition as allowing them to compete in an election fairly would be a way to legitimize the counter-revolution within [their] civil society. Even after Ral Castro steps down as president he remains the head of the Cuban Communist Party and thus the true leader of the nation.

The woman who has not been identified claimed that she purchased another ticket for her feathered friend when the airline turned down her request Fox News reported. A United Airlines spokesperson however claimed that the woman had been warned that her peacock would not be allowed on board. This animal did not meet guidelines for a number of reasons including its weight and size. We explained this to the customers on three separate occasions before they arrived at the airport United Airlines announced in a statement. The travel talk show called The Jet Set shared photos and a video of the woman taking her peacock into the airport. The photos and video have already been shared hundreds of times on Facebook. Im not kidding this woman is wrangling her peacock into the airport another woman can be heard saying over the video. That just happened. What the hell New York? Airline representatives and disability support advocates met in 2016 to establish guidelines for passengers who wish to bring their therapy animals on their flights. Since that meeting took place airlines have been reevaluating their policies on bringing emotional support animals on board flights. Delta Airlines announced January 19 that as of March 1 2018 any passengers flying with emotional support animals must provide vaccination records proof of animal training and a health form signed off by a veterinarian to the airline with at least 48 hours notice. Under the new policy Delta would also deny boarding to any exotic emotional support animals including ferrets insects or hooved animals. United announced that they are considering a similar policy telling Fox News that they are reevaluating their existing policy on emotional support animals.,,"7u6jeu,7u6ifz,",2,0,"Right_Wing_Politics,TheNewsFeed,","ultimaregem,thefeedbot,"

Policy analysts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta were told of the list of forbidden words at a meeting Thursday with senior CDC officials who oversee the budget according to an analyst who took part in the 90-minute briefing. The forbidden words are: ""vulnerable"" ""entitlement"" ""diversity"" ""transgender"" ""fetus"" ""evidence-based"" and ""science-based."" In some instances the analysts were given alternative phrases. Instead of ""science-based"" or ""evidence-based"" the suggested phrase is ""CDC bases its recommendations on science in consideration with community standards and wishes"" the person said. In other cases no replacement words were immediately offered. The question of how to address such issues as sexual orientation gender identity and abortion rights - all of which received significant visibility under the Obama administration - has surfaced repeatedly in federal agencies since President Donald Trump took office. Several key departments - including Health and Human Services which oversees CDC as well as Justice Education and Housing and Urban Development - have changed some federal policies and how they collect government information about lesbian gay bisexual and transgender Americans. In March for example HHS dropped questions about sexual orientation and gender identity in two surveys of elderly people. HHS has also removed information about LGBT Americans from its website. The departments Administration for Children and Families for example archived a page that outlined federal services that are available for LGBT people and their families including how they can adopt and receive help if they are the victims of sex trafficking. At the CDC the meeting about the banned words was led by Alison Kelly a senior leader in CDCs Office of Financial Services according to the CDC analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly. Kelly did not say why the words are being banned according to the analyst and told the group that she was merely relaying the information. Other CDC officials confirmed the existence of a list of forbidden words. Its likely that other parts of HHS are operating under the same guidelines regarding the use of these words the analyst said. At the CDC several offices have responsibilities for work that uses some of these words. The National Center for HIV/AIDS Viral Hepatitis STD and TB Prevention is working on ways to prevent HIV among transgender people and reduce health disparities. The CDCs work on birth defects caused by the Zika virus for example includes research on the developing fetus. The ban is related to the budget and supporting materials that are to be given to CDCs partners and to Congress the analyst said. The presidents budget for 2019 is expected to be released in early February. The budget blueprint is generally shaped to reflect an administrations priorities. Federal agencies are sending in their budget proposals to the Office of Management and Budget which has authority about what is included. Neither an OMB spokesman nor a CDC spokeswoman responded to requests for comment Friday. The longtime CDC analyst whose job includes writing descriptions of the CDCs work for the administrations annual spending blueprint could not recall a previous time when words were banned from budget documents because they were considered controversial. The reaction of people in the meeting was ""incredulous"" the analyst said. ""It was very much Are you serious? Are you kidding? "" ""In my experience weve never had any pushback from an ideological standpoint"" the analyst said. News of the ban on certain words hasnt yet spread to the broader group of scientists at the CDC but its likely to provoke a backlash the analyst said. ""Our subject matter experts will not lay down quietly - this hasnt trickled down to them yet."" The CDC has a budget of about $7 billion and more than 12000 employees working across the nation and around the globe on everything from food and water safety to heart disease and cancer to infectious disease outbreak prevention. Much of the CDCs work has strong bipartisan support. Kelly told the analysts that ""certain words"" in the CDCs budget drafts were being sent back to the agency for corrections. Three words that had been flagged in these drafts were ""vulnerable"" ""entitlement"" and ""diversity."" Kelly told the group she had been authorized to give verbal instructions about the remaining banned words.",,"7k80u1,7k7opm,7k819m,7k5zp1,7k6quk,",69,43,"ainbow,lgbt,LGBTnews,ChronicPain,Libertarian,","DWarren_57,DWarren_57,DWarren_57,pa07950,urban__sombrero,"

If the Democrats had won the election we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it! said Denzel Washington at a press conference in New York. They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections said Denzil Washington who has just been nominated for an Oscar for his film Roman J. Israel Esq. The nomination marks the eighth time Washington has been nominated in the best actor category making him the most-nominated African-American actor of all time. Asked by a reporter if he was sure the memo released by Congress on Friday was reliable Denzil Washington said Hell yeah its reliable. We dont need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly whats happened here. We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. You guys cant see what is wrong with this? Youre kidding me The Equalizer actor said before adding Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about the Democratic Party. I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But youve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided a war with Russia and we avoided the creation of an Orwellian police state. Roman J. Israel Esq. is available digitally now with the Blu-ray and DVD hitting shelves Feb. 13.,,,0,0,,

Earlier this year Catholic priest Jose Garcia Ataulfo admitted to raping 30 young girls aged between 5 and 10 years old in Oaxaca Southern Mexico. Ataulfo was cleared of any wrong-doing by the church and didnt face any criminal charges despite the fact that he knew he was infected with HIV when he sexually abused all the children he is known to have raped. As part of Pope Franciss more merciful approach to child abusing clergy Ataulfo was relocated to a different church to seek prayer and forgiveness for his sins. Now it seems as though his past has caught up with him after his dead body was found crucified outside his new church in a rural area of Villa Alta. Ataulfo was found tied from a wooden beam that was hanging from a large tree branch by members of his congregation who had arrived for Sunday mass to find the church closed.According to local police he had been beaten before he was crucified and his genitals had been removed and placed in his mouth. He also had hot road tar poured onto the top of his head which appears to have been done as torture after he was hung up but while he was still alive. His robes had been removed and burned on the floor and he had been dressed in rags and had a wooden plaque nailed to his hand that was engraved with the words: I am no man of God I am a demon. I will pay for my crimes in hell. Police believe that he may have been killed by the violent drug gang known as the Knights Templar. The Knights Templar Cartel (Spanish: Los Caballeros Templarios) is a Mexican criminal organization composed of remnants of the defunct La Familia Michoacana drug cartel and are known for their brutal executions. According to local media reports it is thought that Ataulfo may have had a price on his head for his past crimes and the cartel may have been tipped-off as to where he had been relocated to. Speaking to reporters police spokesman Manuel Moreno Rivas said: This looks like the work of a cartel so we wont get any answers on this one. We might as well chalk this case up as a suicide. I dont think anyone will lose any sleep over that will they? We heard what this guy had done to those kids so lets just leave it there. Ataulfo admitted to sexually assaulting well over two dozen children many of whom were indigenous young girls from Oaxaca a state in southern Mexico known for its large indigenous population. The mother of one of the priests victims wrote a letter to The Pope asking to meet with him in Rome to discuss the case but was shunned by the Vatican who declared that the matter is closed. Due to the significant influence that the Catholic Church wields in Mexico the priest didnt face any criminal charges particularly for his crimes in areas populated by indigenous ethnic groups. The report which first appeared on the Spanish-language news site Urgente24.com says the priest was absolved of any wrongdoing by the Archdiocese of Mexico. Earlier this year Pope Francis announced that the church would be reducing penalties for pedophile priests by relocating them to a different church and offering them support rather than punishing them. The Pope said that the controversial measures were designed to create a more merciful church. According to The Daily Mail sexual abuse of minors by priests and the subsequent cover-ups by bishops and other Church officials have been widespread in many countries including the United States. The issue was thrust into the national spotlight in 2002 when the Boston Globe revealed the extent to which the local archdiocese shielded abusive priests from being exposed to the public even though it knew they posed a danger to young parishioners. The Globe expos which detailed abuse cases that numbered in the thousands over a span of several decades inspired other victims to come forward leading to an avalanche of lawsuits and criminal prosecutions. Not only did the floodgates open in the US but the Catholic Church was also forced to confront cases in other countries including Mexico. In 2004 the Vatican re-opened a prior investigation against Marcial Maciel who was accused of sexually abusing minors as well as fathering six children by three different women. Though the allegations spanned decades and the extent of his crimes was known to church officials it was only in 2006 that the Vatican forced Maciel one of its most powerful clergymen to retire from active ministry.,,,0,0,,

Stroke has a new indicator! They say if you forward this to ten people you stand a chance of saving one life. Will you send this along? Blood Clots/Stroke They Now Have a Fourth Indicator the Tongue. During a BBQ a woman stumbled and took a little fall she assured everyone that she was fine and she said she had just tripped over a brick because of her new shoes. They got her cleaned up and got her a new plate of food. While she appeared a bit shaken up Jane went about enjoying herself the rest of the evening. Janes husband called later telling everyone that his wife had been taken to the hospital (at 6:00 PM Jane passed away.) She had suffered a stroke at the BBQ. Had they known how to identify the signs of a stroke perhaps Jane would be with us today. Some dont die. They end up in a helpless hopeless condition instead. It only takes a minute to read this. A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he can totally reverse the effects of a stroketotally. He said the trick was getting a stroke recognized diagnosed and then getting the patient medically cared for within 3 hours which is tough. IDENTIFYING A STROKE Thank God for the sense to remember the 3 steps STR. Read and Learn! Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke. Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple questions: S *Ask the individual to SMILE. T *Ask the person to TALK and SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE (Coherently) (i.e. Chicken Soup) R *Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS. If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE of these tasks call emergency number immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher. New Sign of a Stroke Stick out Your Tongue NOTE: Another sign of a stroke is this: Ask the person to stick out their tongue. If the tongue is crooked if it goes to one side or the other that is also an indication of a stroke. A cardiologist said that if everyone who gets this message shared it with 10 people; you can bet that at least one life will be saved. I have done my part. Will you?

Yet a recent study has found that there are some important things we do not know about this kitchen staple. First of all aluminum is a neurotoxic heavy metal that has severe side-effects on the function of the brain and has even been associated with Alzheimers disease. According to medical experts the exposure to this heavy metal might cause long- lasting adverse effects including mental decline and loss of balance memory coordination and bodily control. This study has found that cooking with aluminum foil affects the bones as aluminum builds up inside the bones and takes the space of calcium reducing its levels. Moreover researchers have related cooking with aluminum foil with pulmonary fibrosis and other respiratory issues as a result of the inhalation of aluminum particles. The same effects are achieved in the case of grilling with aluminum. Numerous people are still unaware of the fact that when aluminum foil is exposed to high temperatures it emits parts of the metal into the food and the heavy metal might leech in it. Dr. Essam Zubaidy a chemical engineering researcher at the American University of Sharjah has evaluated the effects of aluminum on cooking and found that a meal cooked in aluminum foil can include up to 400mg of aluminum. This means that The higher the temperature the more the leaching. Foil is not suitable for cooking and is not suitable for using with vegetables like tomatoes citrus juice or spices. The RDA (recommended daily allowance) for aluminum according to the World Health Organization is limited to 60mg daily.

The Bermuda Triangle Bermuda Triangle does not need any introduction. If you ever read anything upon the biggest unsolved mysteries in the world I am sure Bermuda Triangle wouldve topped that list! It is famous for sucking in (mysteriously) anything and everything that comes in its area. Right from flights to ships everything has lost its way in here. But what happened recently might just be the curse breaker for this scary place. 2. The Reappeared Ship Apparently something happened that this Triangle is not really known for. A ship that was lost recently reappeared magically behind the winds within the waves. Well this is no joke my friends. On a very serious note a ship just reappeared mysteriously out of nowhere. 3. Was First Spotted On The Cuban Coast Guard announced that they had intercepted an unmanned ship heading for the island which is presumed to be the SS Cotopaxi a tramp steamer which vanished in December 1925 and has since been connected to the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. See told yll I was serious! This ship was first spotted on May 16 near a restricted military zone west of Havana by the Cuban authorities! They made many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the crew and finally mobilized three patrol boats to intercept it. 4. When It First Vanished On 29 November 1925 the SS Cotopaxi departed Charleston South Carolina and headed towards Havana Cuba. The ship had a crew of 32 men under the command of Captain W. J. Meyer and was carrying a cargo of 2340 tons of coal. It was reported missing two days later and was unheard of for almost 90 years. When the ship was first lost no one mustve imagined that itll reappear 90 years later in such condition. But to everyones surprise it did. 5. The Investigation The Vice President of Council of Ministers General Abelardo Colome announced that the Cuban authorities were going to conduct a thorough investigation to elucidate the mystery of the ships disappearance and reappearance. After this incident the scientists are already excited about the new pattern of research theyll conduct in the area. Lets wait an watch if some more missing things resurface back in this area! Hopefully!,,,0,0,,

In a written response to Trumps speech Faiz Shakir the ACLUs national political director said: Tonight President Trump said the word America more than 80 times in his speech. Yet after a divisive first year we hear and feel how exclusionary that America is with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities. The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities both in the courts and at the polls. In particular the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force. We are at this crossroads because of the Presidents deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric. We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let Americas Dreamers be deported. READ THE REST,,,0,0,,

He went to the doctor because he thought he was getting pink eye when doctors told him he had eye cancer and if you use your cell phone at night in the dark?? This could happen to you!! As you know the human eye consists of complex tissue and particles. Even when you tend to stay awake till late at night you may sometimes notice a slight redness or even tiny red veins in your eyes as a result of stress on your eye tissue. Imagine the result when you not only stay awake but subject your eyes to the radiation of a cell phone screen every night. This is what caused this man to get eye cancer was his cell phone! Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google+ According to this man he used his phone in the dark for about 30 minutes every night for a month and then he started having eye problems. At first he thought it was conjunctivitis or Pink eye but his doctors confirmed it to be eye cancer. Now some people may refer to the white of the eye as albumin but the actual term is the SCLERA. Thats what the white of your eye is called. The white of the eye is not albumin just because its white. Albumin is present in the lining of the cornea or the dark part of your eye. The sclera consists of collagen and elastin. Beneath the sclera is the vitreous humor of the eye. When the eye is inflamed it turns red. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google+ A recently concluded German study showed that constant use of cell phones could cause tumors in the eye. What most people including you may not know is that your phone emits a radioactive light from its screen. When using cell in the dark its focus is mainly upon your eyes with the high potential to cause irrevocable eye damage. In prolonged use the result was evident in this 40-year-old man who got diagnosed with eye cancer. Scientific research in the past has always recommended protection of eyes from TV and computer screens despite of them being a distance away. One can well imagine the extent of damage in this mans eyes especially when evidence has proved that the greenish light from cell phones have the power to damage the cells in the vitreous humor and the retina. This was no pink eye. This man was diagnosed with eye cancer and he had himself to blame. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google+ Using a cell phone in the dark will result in the radioactive light concentrating on your eyes with no surrounding light source to neutralize it. It was because of this that the man got eye cancer. The biggest problem was that his doctors werent able to do much for him as the medical technology does not allow replacing the vitreous humor or even a cornea of the human eye. In Hong Kong and China as well as most parts of the world macular degeneration and eye problems are affecting a higher percentage of young people. The biggest culprit is the cell phone. Thus when you use your cell phone never do it in the dark. Moreover always keep it at a safe distance from your eyes. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google+ Here are some tips to reduce eye strain when looking at your phones and your computers: 1. Blink blink and blink again 2. Minimize glare 3. Take breaks 4. Adjust your brightness 5. Tweak your text size and contrast 6. Keep a clean screen 7. Hold your smartphone farther away If you like this blog dont forget to share it.

Our message to them DO IT. We dont need jerks such as you in Hollywood besides. The fact that human beings like Rosie ODonnell suppose that the film and television industry wouldnt live to tell the tale without them proves just how ignorant they genuinely are. Mike Opelka referred to as out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike warning them of the harm this strike could purpose to everyone else in the industry. He cited the lower paid help group of workers who do all of the backstage paintings. The people who do all the actual paintings in Hollywood are the those who construct the sets who make the costumes who create the props and in some instances do the stunts and the computer graphicsMike explained. And theyre no longer getting the bazillion dollar offers. Its about time that those jerkoffs recognize that they arent the most effective human beings on this world. The reality stays that Donald Trump is our President whether they prefer it or now not and that isnt approximately to alternate. Lets wish that for the sake of everyone else in Hollywood those ignorant celebrities suck it up and cope with the truth that their candidate didnt win. Maybe if they took their heads out in their asses lengthy sufficient to even concentrate to Trumps desires for his time in workplace they might feel exceptional.

Well hed have to start with his own estate first. Joe Kennedys Palm Beach Florida mansion now on the market has sprawling walls surrounding the property. After President Donald Trumps highly-praised State Of The Union address broadcast to over 40+ million Americans Joe Kennedy gave an response that was overshadowed by an odd background featuring the remains of a car wreck and an apparent overuse of lip balm. But during the actual speech Kennedy said one thing that quickly turned him into Americas biggest hypocrite. Build a wall and my generation will tear it down Kennedy stated boldly. Well hed have to start with his own estate first. Joe Kennedys Palm Beach Florida mansion now on the market has sprawling walls surrounding the property. Looks exactly like the big beautiful wall Trump wants to build around America. Now isnt that funny Kennedy owns a wall thats an ideal border wall yet trashes the president for wanting to build a wall that looks like the one Kennedy has. Can you get any more hypocritical? Even more interesting is that this estate is only six miles from President Trumps Mar-a-Lago or the Winter White House. In addition the history surrounding the Kennedy familys protection is quite steep famed six-acre Kennedy compound with three homes on the Hyannis Port waterfront often had extra layers of police protection due to tourist curiosity surrounding the Kennedys perhaps they wanted the illegals off their property? Its unclear if these walls and border protections were morally reprehensible in the eyes of the 37-year-old Kennedy. He also added We choose the thousands of American communities whose roads arent paved with power and privilege but with honest effort good faith and the resolve to build something better for their kids. Building something better apparently doesnt include walls. SHARE on Facebook and Twitter if youre ready to build the wall!,,,0,0,,

We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let Americas Dreamers be deported. President Trump told the nation Monday night that Congress will be voting on an immigration reform package over the next few weeks and he outlined the four pillars of his fair compromise plan: The four pillars include a path to citizenship for 1.8 million dreamers if they meet education and work requirements and demostrate good moral character; a fully secure border including a wall in places and hiring more border patrol agents; an end to the random diversity visa lottery and adoption of a merit-based system; and an end to chain migration by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. (Democrats offered scattered boos to the last item.) These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise and one that will create a safe modern and lawful immigration system Trump said. For over 30 years Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together set politics aside and finally get the job done.,,,0,0,,

If the Democrats had won the election we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it! said Denzel Washington at a press conference in New York. They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections said Denzil Washington who has just been nominated for an Oscar for his film Roman J. Israel Esq. The nomination marks the eighth time Washington has been nominated in the best actor category making him the most-nominated African-American actor of all time. Asked by a reporter if he was sure the memo released by Congress on Friday was reliable Denzil Washington said Hell yeah its reliable. We dont need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly whats happened here. We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. You guys cant see what is wrong with this? Youre kidding me The Equalizer actor said before adding Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about the Democratic Party. I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But youve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided a war with Russia and we avoided the creation of an Orwellian police state. Roman J. Israel Esq. is available digitally now with the Blu-ray and DVD hitting shelves Feb. 13.,,,0,0,,

Today is a historic dayone that will bring joy to the hundreds of millions of Pluto lovers around the globe. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) the body that is responsible for naming and classifying objects in the cosmos has just announced that Pluto has been reclassified as a major planet. Thats right the little dwarf will be rejoining the ranks of Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune and Planet-X (the planet that will surely spell doom for all humanity). As many of you know in 2006 the IAU made their infamousvote deciding to demote everyones favorite planet to a dwarf planet. Their reasoning was that too many people would confuse Pluto (the doggy of Disney fame) with Pluto (the planet of space and stuff). Immediately after this 2006 announcement the public exploded with outrage. There were a number of campaigns launched that were aimed at ensuring that Pluto was reinstated as a planet. These met with no success. Pluto was officially classified as a dwarf planet. But all of that just changed After years of deliberation the IAU announced in a press release that they have reclassified the icy worldthey upgraded Pluto back to its proper standing as a planet. We simply underestimated the publics attachment to Pluto. We realized our error shortly after the decision came down to demote it said Dr. Amy Joggy professor at the Institute of Planetary Studies and head of the IAUs Planetary Classification and Experimental Nomenclature Task Force. We didnt think anyone would really care if a little clump of ice and rock on the outskirts of the solar system was reclassified. Clearly we dun messed up and that makes me super sad face. Today we take steps to correct this most grievous of errors. In addition to Plutos reclassification Dr. Joggy has also proposed that the IAU create a new category of planet called a hyper-planet. These hyper-planets according to Dr. Joggy are like regular planets but at least two times as awesome (thanks to the fancy fancy name). It has also been proposed that Pluto be made an honorary member of this new planetary class. In all honesty we feel bad for the way we treated Pluto and more importantly all those that cared about it so greatly- the public showed us our error.

Today is a historic dayone that will bring joy to the hundreds of millions of Pluto lovers around the globe. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) the body that is responsible for naming and classifying objects in the cosmos has just announced that Pluto has been reclassified as a major planet. Thats right the little dwarf will be rejoining the ranks of Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune and Planet-X (the planet that will surely spell doom for all humanity). As many of you know in 2006 the IAU made their infamousvote deciding to demote everyones favorite planet to a dwarf planet. Their reasoning was that too many people would confuse Pluto (the doggy of Disney fame) with Pluto (the planet of space and stuff). Immediately after this 2006 announcement the public exploded with outrage. There were a number of campaigns launched that were aimed at ensuring that Pluto was reinstated as a planet. These met with no success. Pluto was officially classified as a dwarf planet. But all of that just changed After years of deliberation the IAU announced in a press release that they have reclassified the icy worldthey upgraded Pluto back to its proper standing as a planet. We simply underestimated the publics attachment to Pluto. We realized our error shortly after the decision came down to demote it said Dr. Amy Joggy professor at the Institute of Planetary Studies and head of the IAUs Planetary Classification and Experimental Nomenclature Task Force. We didnt think anyone would really care if a little clump of ice and rock on the outskirts of the solar system was reclassified. Clearly we dun messed up and that makes me super sad face. Today we take steps to correct this most grievous of errors. In addition to Plutos reclassification Dr. Joggy has also proposed that the IAU create a new category of planet called a hyper-planet. These hyper-planets according to Dr. Joggy are like regular planets but at least two times as awesome (thanks to the fancy fancy name).

Yet after a divisive first year we hear and feel how exclusionary that America is with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities. The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities both in the courts and at the polls.In particular the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force. We are at this crossroads because of the Presidents deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric. We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let Americas Dreamers be deported.""

Toward the end when the crowd filled the chamber with chants of USA USA USA Rep. Luis Gutierrez D-Ill. hoisted a metaphorical progressive banner as he marched out of the chamber in protest. Trump reached across the aisle repeatedly during the hour-and-a-half address. Progressives like Gutierrez didnt even hide the fact that they were slapping it away. Not all Democrats were so sullen though. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. clapped a couple times and some senators in his conference even stood for the occasional applause line. No one can blame them for not cheering louder. After all it is the job of the minority to check the majority. The resistance from Gutierrez and company was different. Normally progressives like trillion-dollar infrastructure projects. But they would rather rip up any check that comes with Trumps signature. Historically progressives have championed a permanent solution for the so-called ""Dreamers"" immigrants brought to this country illegally as children. But they are already balking at any amnesty deal. Generally progressives are willing to negotiate at least at the margins of a Republican agenda. But they see anything less than a complete and total scorched-earth strategy as unacceptable. Shortly after exiting the chamber Gutierrez summarized his position. I was hoping to get through my life without having to witness an outwardly explicitly racist American President he wrote in a statement. My luck ran out. With that Gutierrez managed to do something normally quite impossible. By writing off compromise completely barely a week after the government shutdown the progressive has made Trump look like the good-faith honest adult in the room.",,"7uay7w,7ufhbm,7u7lm8,7u7enw,7u9xsu,",44,47,"The_Donald,ColinsLastStand,AutoNewspaper,WAEXauto,politics,","thecricketsareloudin,yanksb4life,AutoNewspaperAdmin,AutoNewsAdmin,nick40vmi,"

1154,http://yournewswire.com/fda-homeopathic-remedies-illegal/,https://www.snopes.com/homeopathic-drugs-now-illegal/,2018-02-01,2000.0,false,The American Food and Drug Administration has announced plans to make homeopathic remedies illegal as part of their crackdown on alternative medicine. The FDA plans to target all remedies that arent produced by Big Pharma forcing them to register for an FDA license. Dr Mercola reports: [I]n one fell swoop the FDA has declared that virtually every single homeopathic drug on the market is being sold illegally the Alliance for Natural Health USA (ANH USA) wrote and its not an exaggeration. In essence the FDAs guidance reads: Any homeopathic drug that has not been considered generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/E) is considered a new drug FDA has not determined that any homeopathic drugs are GRAS/E A new drug cannot be marketed unless it goes through the FDAs approval process No homeopathic drugs have gone through FDA approval nor can any producer afford to take them through the approval process The FDA then states that its proposing a new risk-based enforcement approach and first plans to target the unapproved drug products labeled as homeopathic that have the greatest potential to cause risk to patients. This includes: Products with reported safety concerns Products that contain or claim to contain ingredients associated with potentially significant safety concerns Products for routes of administration other than oral and topical Products intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of serious and/or life-threatening diseases and conditions Products for vulnerable populations Products that do not meet standards of quality strength or purity as required under the law FDA Does About-Face Penalizes an Entire Industry The draft guidance is a complete turnaround from the FDAs prior stance on homeopathic remedies which stated under the 1988 Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 400.400 Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed they did not need to get FDA approval prior to coming on the market. Instead the ingredients in homeopathic remedies were to be verified by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS). As noted by law firm Venable: Essentially the HPUS creates a monograph for homeopathic drugs to follow not dissimilar to the OTC drug monographs that FDA has developed for allopathic drugs. Accordingly by virtue of an ingredients inclusion in the HPUS the ingredient has already been closely examined and determined to be safe and effective by the HPCUS [Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention of the United States]. Compliance with the HPUS functions as a premarket review of safety and effectiveness in the homeopathic context. By classifying homeopathic drugs as unapproved new drugs the FDA is requiring a second showing of safety and effectiveness a step that is unnecessary not to mention impractical given that the Agency intends to hold homeopathic products to an allopathic standard that is inappropriate given the nature of homeopathic products. Further it was by the FDAs own deliberate decision that homeopathic drugs were excluded from former drug approval processes and intended to be a separate category. Venable continued: The FDA deliberately excluded homeopathic drugs from both the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) review (the process by which all drugs approved between 1938 and 1962 were retrospectively evaluated by the FDA for effectiveness) and the OTC Drug Review in 1972 (the process used to develop OTC drug monographs for allopathic drugs) deciding instead in the latter case to regulate homeopathic products separately because of their uniqueness. By withdrawing the CPG and classifying all homeopathic drugs as unapproved drugs subject to FDA drug approval the FDA is now requiring higher regulatory thresholds for OTC homeopathic drugs than are applicable to allopathic OTC drugs many of which are permitted to be sold pursuant to the FDA monograph system. This move in effect penalizes an entire industry for the Agencys 1972 decision. FTC Targeted Homeopathy in 2016 The FDA isnt the first government agency to target this centuries old natural medicine system. In a notice filed in November 2016 the FTC stated that in order for homeopathic remedies to claim they are effective their makers must provide proof. If no proof is provided the remedies must state there is no scientific evidence that the product works. In order to not mislead consumers the FTC further stated that homeopathic remedies lacking sufficient proof must communicate to consumers that the products claims are based only on theories of homeopathy from the 1700s that are not accepted by most modern medical experts. Dana Ullman MPH CCH one of the leading advocates for homeopathy in the U.S. said at the time: Considering the longtime safety history of homeopathic medicines it is surprising and even shocking that the FTC would consider proposing new regulations now. One cannot help but wonder who or what is pulling their strings policies commonly result from powerful economic forces at play it is clear that this governmental agency is ignoring important scientific evidence and one must wonder if they are protecting Big Pharma from competition more than protecting the consumer. Does Homeopathy Work? Based on the theory that like cures like or the Law of Similars homeopathy was founded by German physician Dr. Samuel Hahnemann. The idea is that health conditions can be healed by treating a person with minute doses of a substance that would produce similar symptoms to their health condition if given in larger doses. Homeopathys other guiding principle is that of the minimum dose which is based on the premise that the more a substance is diluted the more potent homeopathic remedy it becomes known as the law of infinitesimals. Homeopathic remedies may be made from plants minerals or other substances and are commonly administered in pellet form dissolved under the tongue. A number of intriguing studies suggest homeopathy is effective and safe for a variety of ailments including flu. According to Ullman: The use of a homeopathic medicine called Oscillococcinum is an example of a remedy that can be effective for many people with the flu though clinical experience suggests that it is most effective when used within 48 hours of getting flu symptoms. Although most homeopathic medicines are made from the plant or mineral kingdom Oscillococcinum is unusual in that it is made from the heart and liver of a duck. In one study nearly twice as many patients who were given Oscillococcinum recovered from the flu within 48 hours as those given a placebo. Further Ullman noted: A different group of researchers conducted a randomized double-blind study involving 372 patients (188 treated with Oscillococcinum and 187 with placebo) of both sexes ranging in age from 12 to 60 who presented rectal temperature 100.4 F muscle pains headache or at least one of the following symptoms: shivering chest pain spine pain coughing irritation of nasal mucosa or feeling of malaise. Patients received three tubes of Oscillococcinum or placebo each day (morning noon and night) for three days. The results of this trial show a highly statistically significant difference between the two groups for what concerns disappearance of symptoms after 48 hours (19.2 percent in the Oscillococcinum group versus 17.1 percent in the placebo group) and improvement in symptoms (43.7 percent versus 38.6 percent for placebo). Additional research shows homeopathys promising role in the following conditions: In patients with allergies those using homeopathy reported improvements in nasal airflow compared with a placebo group. With homeopathic treatment the researchers described a clear significant and clinically relevant improvement in nasal inspiratory peak flow similar to that found with topical steroids. Homeopathy significantly reduced the severity and duration of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis (swelling and sores in the mouth) in children. Homeopathic medicine was effective in treating acute childhood diarrhea decreasing both the duration of the diarrhea and the number of stools per day. Homeopathy has positive effects in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) particularly in the areas of behavioral and cognitive functions. Homeopathy lessened tender point pain and improved quality of life in people with fibromyalgia. Homeopathic was effective in treating the early stages of vitiligo in a report of 14 cases FDA Continues to Crack Down on Natural Substances Protect Big Pharma The FDAs new push to regulate homeopathic products is eerily reminiscent of their recent crackdown on the plant kratom. Leaves from the kratom tree have been used for pain relief for hundreds of years but scientists now know they contain compounds that target the brain similarly to opioids helping to relieve pain. It appears the plant may be safer than opioids for pain relief and could even act as a tool to help those suffering from opioid withdrawal. In November 2017 however rather than targeting the prescription opioids that are the root of the opioid epidemic the FDA issued a public health advisory regarding risks associated with kratom use suggesting that its usage could expand the opioid epidemic. What this comes down to for some is the right to choose what form of medicine to put in your body. As Dr. Lee Hieb an orthopedic surgeon and past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons wrote in WND: Im not here to tout any particular over-the-counter remedy but who gave the FDA total ability to limit what we can take into our bodies while virtually forcing us to be given what they prescribe? Its none of their business whether a homeopathic remedy is worthless. Thats an issue of commerce and truth in advertising. I for one want the freedom to research and decide for myself what supplements to take even if my supplements ultimately do me no good. (Many do a great deal of good as Big Pharma knows only too well.) People have the right to choose their treatment and doctors (many of whom admit to prescribing placebos to their patients) also retain the right to offer treatments they deem useful whether it be homeopathy or another remedy. As for the FDAs new draft guidance on homeopathic drugs its attempting to discredit such remedies proven healing powers before their mechanisms of action have even been fully understood. If you want to express your opinion on the matter the FDA is accepting comments from the public until March 30 2018.,,,0,0,,

The music industry mogul who recently engaged in a Twitter spat with President Trump can be seen delivering a straight right jab to the young girls face before following up with flat-handed right roughly pushing her away from him. The shocking footage is the just the latest in a long line of scandals surrounding Jay-Z a known Satanist who promotes the Luciferian ideology of the New World Order. At age 12 Jay-Z shot his brother in the shoulder for stealing his ring. Speaking about the incident to ABC 7 the world-renowned rapper and producer who belonged to a gang said that he thought he would go to jail forever. But he didnt go to jail and his antics got worse. He has rapped about selling crack to his mother but has lately started claiming it was other mothers. Jay-Z also got three years probation for stabbing record executive Lance Un Rivera at a party in 1999. The far left rapper who has plans to run for president in 2020 hit the headlines after calling President Trump a superbug on CNN this week and then went on to explain how black people dont care about his economic success because Its not about money at the end of the day. Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28 2018 Is Jay-Z a Satanist? During a backstage rant at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans in November Jay-Z claimed Satanism has gotten a bad rap due to mentally challenged Christians and their desire to be slaves but Satanism is actually the highest form of being. There is real spirituality and guidance in the Church of Satan that you just dont get in Christianity because Christianity is a fake religion built by assholes Jay-Z said. Hands up how many Christians here have prayed to God for years and aint gotten nothing back just silence and emptiness? As the small crowd of ticket winners began to murmur nervously Jay-Z announced I can answer for yall because I am free. Because I recognized Jesus is the original fake news designed to enslave humanity. Im telling you this because I know you guys look up to me and want to emulate me. I will give you this one guarantee if you start following the doctrine of Lucifer you will taste success. The secret of the universe opens up to you. It is immediate and glorious. The 99 Problems rapper also hinted at his Satanic beliefs onstage telling audiences to ignore the rules of the venue and the security staff trying to enforce them. Instead of respecting the rules Jay-Z instructed his audience to Do what thou wilt. It has long been known that Jay-Z is a follower of Aleister Crowley the English occultist and founder of the Satanic religion Thelema. Jay-Zs Satanic preaching is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the rapper has shared with the dark side. After starting his career as an aspirational rapper he reinvented his image as a dark lord flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as he rode to the top of the rap game. Since establishing himself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer Jay-Z has attempted to tone down his dark image. But the disturbing conversation he held in New Orleans and the footage of him punching a girl in the face suggest he is far from a reformed character and he has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society.,,,0,0,,

The Bermuda Triangle Bermuda Triangle does not need any introduction. If you ever read anything upon the biggest unsolved mysteries in the world I am sure Bermuda Triangle wouldve topped that list! It is famous for sucking in (mysteriously) anything and everything that comes in its area. Right from flights to ships everything has lost its way in here. But what happened recently might just be the curse breaker for this scary place. 2. The Reappeared Ship Apparently something happened that this Triangle is not really known for. A ship that was lost recently reappeared magically behind the winds within the waves. Well this is no joke my friends. On a very serious note a ship just reappeared mysteriously out of nowhere. 3. Was First Spotted On The Cuban Coast Guard announced that they had intercepted an unmanned ship heading for the island which is presumed to be the SS Cotopaxi a tramp steamer which vanished in December 1925 and has since been connected to the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. See told yll I was serious! This ship was first spotted on May 16 near a restricted military zone west of Havana by the Cuban authorities! They made many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the crew and finally mobilized three patrol boats to intercept it. 4. When It First Vanished On 29 November 1925 the SS Cotopaxi departed Charleston South Carolina and headed towards Havana Cuba. The ship had a crew of 32 men under the command of Captain W. J. Meyer and was carrying a cargo of 2340 tons of coal. It was reported missing two days later and was unheard of for almost 90 years. When the ship was first lost no one mustve imagined that itll reappear 90 years later in such condition. But to everyones surprise it did 5. The Investigation The Vice President of Council of Ministers General Abelardo Colome announced that the Cuban authorities were going to conduct a thorough investigation to elucidate the mystery of the ships disappearance and reappearance. After this incident the scientists are already excited about the new pattern of research theyll conduct in the area. Lets wait an watch if some more missing things resurface back in this area!

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. Mann Packing one of the largest vegetable packaging companies in the United States has just issued a recall of their vegetable products as well as a warning to consumers. After detailed analysis of their vegetable products it was found that a Listeria contamination of their vegetable products could potentially affect millions of Americans.If you have shopped at any of the following stores in the past month you could be at risk for contamination: Walmart Trader Joes Aldi Safeway Albertsons PakN Save Vons Target H-E-B Listeria a deadly bacteria often linked to food poisoning incidents has the potential to severely impact pregnant women newborns the elderly and even some adults.

The team already in a market saturated with Dolphins Bucs and Falcons fans made the unfortunate mistake of drafting developing and hiring almost exclusively black players leaving them vulnerable to the latest round of weve been treated unfairly protests from millionaires. This particular protest unfortunately happened on national TV and pissed off every God-fearing country-loving American who has either had the honor to serve or know someone who did. They might as well have wiped their proverbial asses with the American flag. last week 31 of the 42 men on the Jacksonville roster took a knee during the national anthem. The coaches just stopped paying attention and went on with their game planning while the few patriots who braved the picket lines to make sure someone was there to respect the flag and our veterans stood and sang the song with pride. Jacksonville is a dead stick. Its been obvious for several years now that an expansion franchise there was a bad idea. The front office isnt responding to comment but an insider tells us that the reorganization will allow the team to stay above water while they pitch a move to the now-empty St. Louis market. What they dont understand is that their market isnt the main problem. They could survive as another Cardinals or expansion Browns team if they didnt have the issue with the players. Our insider tells us thats being taken care of as well. The selling power of the team is the organization and equipment. Salaries wont be covered in the bankruptcy. After this season as many as 24 players will be on their own.,,,0,0,,

James M. Bradley Jr. 60 is believed to be from Haverhill. He was booked into a federal jail on human trafficking charges for his alleged role in what U.S. Attorney Richard Durbin called an alien smuggling venture gone horribly wrong. Were working on a complaint right now Durbin said. Hes in custody and he will be charged. The truck was parked at a back corner of the Walmart parking lot since Saturday night. The eight immigrants are believed to have died as a result of heat exposure/asphyxiation according to a Methuen Police Department news release but an official cause of death will be Determined. Officials said it was a refrigerated trailer but the air conditioning wasnt working. Experts estimate the temperature inside the closed-in trailer could have reached dangerous levels; at just 80 degrees outside the temperature inside a closed vehicle can reach 115 degrees in a half hour according to the National Weather Service. Methuen reached Saturdays high of 87 degree at 6 p.m. Methuen Police was alerted by a Walmart employee who was approached by someone in the truck who asked the employee for water. Engine 4 arrived at 12:26 a.m. Hood said and firefighters started extricating patients out of the back of a semi-truck. The air conditioning was not working. Our paramedics and firefighters found that each patient had heart rates over about 130 beats per minute and were very hot to the touch Police did not know the victims country of origin destination or ages of the deceased or injured according the press release. Four males and one female are at Tufs Hospital in Boston. At least one person was being admitted into ICU a hospital representative said. The victims included adults and at least two children. The two youngest victims who are among the injured are 15 years old police said. While it is not known how long the tractor-trailer had been in the parking lot the temperature inside the truck would have climbed rapidly he said. Most of the heating that would occur once someone is inside of a vehicle that doesnt have AC would occur in the first 30 minutes of them being in there Runyen said. For instance if there was an outside air temperature of only 80 degrees within about 30 minutes the inside air temperate of a vehicle would be almost 115 degrees.,,,0,0,,

If the Democrats had won the election we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it! said Denzel Washington at a press conference in New York. They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections said Denzil Washington who has just been nominated for an Oscar for his film Roman J. Israel Esq. The nomination marks the eighth time Washington has been nominated in the best actor category making him the most-nominated African-American actor of all time. Asked by a reporter if he was sure the memo released by Congress on Friday was reliable Denzil Washington said Hell yeah its reliable. We dont need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly whats happened here. We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. You guys cant see what is wrong with this? Youre kidding me The Equalizer actor said before adding Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about the Democratic Party. I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But youve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided a war with Russia and we avoided the creation of an Orwellian police state. Roman J. Israel Esq. is available digitally now with the Blu-ray and DVD hitting shelves Feb. 13.,,,0,0,,

1191,https://healthimpactnews.com/2018/fda-declares-all-homeopathic-drugs-illegal-threatening-remedies-for-millions-of-americans/,https://www.snopes.com/homeopathic-drugs-now-illegal/,2018-02-01,2000.0,false,FDA: All Homeopathic Drugs Illegal by ANH-USA But not all will be pulled from the market yet. Action Alert! The policy comes in the form of a guidance document which lays out the FDAs current position on the regulation of homeopathic drugs. In the guidance the FDA says: Any homeopathic drug that has not been considered generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/E) is considered a new drug; FDA has not determined that any homeopathic drugs are GRAS/E; A new drug cannot be marketed unless it goes through the FDAs approval process; No homeopathic drugs have gone through FDA approval nor can any producer afford to take them through the approval process. Thats right: in one fell swoop the FDA has declared that virtually every single homeopathic drug on the market is being sold illegally. The guidance explains that the agency will apply a risk-based regulatory approach that will prioritize enforcement actions against: products with reported safety concerns; products that contain or claim to contain ingredients associated with potentially significant safety concerns e.g. belladonna or strychnine; products for routes of administration other than oral and topical e.g. injectable and ophthalmic products; products intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of serious and/or life-threatening diseases and conditions e.g. cancer heart disease and opioid addition; products for vulnerable populations e.g. children; and products that are deemed adulterated under FDC Act 501 e.g. do not meet standards of quality strength or purity as required under the law. The FDA also says that it recognizes that many homeopathic drugs fall outside of these categories and does not intend to take action against such products at this time but the writing is on the wall. If it wants to the FDA could go after any homeopathic drug currently on the market. Is this level of regulatory scrutiny necessary? No. Although prior to the release of FDAs guidance document homeopathic drugs did not need to go through the New Drug Approval process they underwent a different kind of pre-market approval. Homeopathic drugs traditionally required a monograph from the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS) which involves clinical verification of the efficacy of the substance. FDAs process started two years ago when the agency held a public hearing to evaluate its enforcement policies for homeopathic products. We suspected the agency was planning to tighten its grip on homeopathy which after all competes with the pharmaceutical drugs that fund the FDA. We cannot let the FDA eliminate consumer access to homeopathy. Action Alert!

The commotion alerted the childrens parents who called emergency services.According to the father of the children after calling the police the attacker was in so much pain that he didnt attempt to make an escape.James was rushed to the hospital where doctors treated his wounds but said they were unable to rescue his genitalia after it had been swallowed by the pet bulldog.Hospital staff said they were able to patch him up and while he lost a lot of blood and was clearly in a lot of pain he would survive.They added that although his injuries were no-longer life-threatening they were certainly life-altering.The family who cant be named said they are just thankful their dog was there to protect the young girls from the attacker.The mother of the girls said: Local residents described the incident which happened around 2 am on Monday as being very unusual for the neighborhood.One neighbor said they always leave windows open at night saying we never worry about something like this happening around here.Another local resident described being awoken by the screaming during the incident: I think it woke everyone in the neighborhood up.Ive never heard anything like it.Blood-curdling screams that sounded like something from a horror movie.It must have lasted 20 minutes.When I heard what happened I thought no wonder!Then I thought good. Good doggy.Lt.

U.S.A. Photo: Getty Images / Alex Wong Reports stated that the U.S. Representative for Illinoiss 4th congressional district ducked out of the chamber at the end of Trumps speech while others around him applauded. After his exit Gutierrez issued a response in which he sarcastically said that Trumps speech was well delivered and whoever translated it from Russian did a great job. In his statement Gutierrez also discussed dreamers along with Trumps lack of mention about Puerto Ricans in the aftermath of hurricane Maria. He ended his statement by describing the POTUS as an outwardly and explicitly racist American President. Here is his full statement: Even though I disagreed with almost everything he said for Trump the speech was clear and well-delivered. Whoever translated it for him from Russian did a good job. I am still hopeful but I dont see this Congress and this President coming to an agreement that prevents the deportation of the Dreamers. The White House agenda is to gut legal immigration in exchange for allowing some of the Dreamers to live here. For those of us who support legal immigration and thats most Democrats and many Republicans it wont fly. And the Dreamers themselves have said they do not want legal status if it comes at the expense of others who will suffer more as part of the bargain. The speech did nothing to bring the pro- and anti-immigrant sides closer together. I was hoping for some sort of apology on Puerto Rico but I heard nothing. Puerto Rico is a metaphor for how this President sees all Latinos and people of color: he does not see us as his equals and he does not see us as fellow human beings. If you look at how the President has treated Puerto Rico you have to conclude that he just doesnt care and probably thinks of Puerto Rico as just another shithole country. I was born in 1953 in the U.S. when separate but equal was the law of the land. I am proud of the progress the United States has made as a nation on issues of race gender sexual orientation disabilities and many other areas where we have advanced. I was hoping to get through my life without having to witness an outwardly explicitly racist American President but my luck ran out. However even after his scathing remarks Gutierrezs spokesman insisted that his walkout was not a political gesture but was based on scheduling. He was trying to make it to Univision and watched the last 90 seconds on TV. It was not a protest or anything. He was just trying to get ahead of the crowd he said the Daily Mail reported. Gutierrez who has been an advocate of progressive causes had announced in November that he wont be seeking re-election this year in order to focus all his efforts on helping to repair Puerto Rico after hurricane Marias devastation.,,,0,0,,
1196,https://newspunch.com/nfl-lawyer-dead-super-bowl-rigged/,https://www.snopes.com/nfl-lawyer-dead/,2018-01-29,588.0,false,An NFL entertainment lawyer who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is fixed. Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an gangland-style execution hours after blowing the whistle on the rigged Super Bowl backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis. Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series along with one other man believed to be a close friend. Goodes an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football Leagues 345 Park Avenue HQ had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting next weekends Super Bowl featuring the two teams. However Goodes went off-script in Minneapolis and was physically removed from the premises by security staff but not before publicly condemning the NFL as totally corrupt and claiming the Super Bowl is fixed. Telling reporters that he is a football fan first and foremost and a lawyer second Goodes said Football in America in 2018 doesnt need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesnt pass the sniff test. I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I cant stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me wont allow it. Football in America wont recover from this. Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an gangland-style execution in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story. According to Goodes the NFL have organized a rigged game that will earn maximum revenue for the league and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth. This is the biggest scam in sports history Goodes said in Minneapolis according to reports. The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out. How do I know its scripted? Ive read the damn thing. You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes cant be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises so they dont care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesnt matter to the franchise owners. It doesnt matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here. The sad thing is that its legal. Can you believe that? Its legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me. Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as entertainment Goodes said The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine. The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as entertainment rather than sport as well as incorporate itself as a single entity instead of the 32 separate franchises they would want you to believe. In a 2004 lawsuit the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity providing entertainment in the marketplace and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws. The only other sport that occupies this legal position is the WWE. How are games rigged? According to Goodes the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system. Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesnt happen. Are they that good? Hell no theyre not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every single game. So how is it fixed? Refs manipulate who wins for the overall benefit of the NFL. The NFL splits its revenue between teams so do the players care? Im telling you now they dont care. What player would care if they get an extra $5 million when the salary cap goes up thanks to more revenues built on scripted outcomes? The players have an awareness about it and the refs also make penalty calls in key situations to manipulate the score and outcomes. How come zero players call out the refs? How come zero coaches call out the refs despite the outrageous calls that change the results of games? Everyone is on the same side thats why. First guy to congratulate Brady? Number 34. What a teammate! pic.twitter.com/azXq3qgN43 OurState_CSU (@OurStateCSU) January 21 2018 These NFL refs are part-time employees of the NFL. They sign the tightest contracts you will ever see in your life. They work for the league period. They are bound by NFL mandated gag orders. They cant open their mouth and say a single word to the media or their ass is toast. Why doesnt anyone speak out? According to Goodes people do speak out. But nobody wants to hear. Remember the Harbaugh Bowl? Arthur Blank the Atlanta Falcons owner admitted the results were fixed. It is predetermined that these two teams would be here I was my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl. And the NFL admitted it themselves in court. We are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. Were exempt. Super Bowl LII will be the 52nd Super Bowl and the 48th modern-era NFL championship game contested between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday.,,,0,0,,

Federal debt skyrocketed under Obama. He was printing money by the end of his reign. This is unheard of in our history. He ran the country like a banana republic said Denzel Washington at a New York screening of his new film the legal drama Roman J. Israel Esq. Asked by a reporter whether his information about Obama was correct Denzel Washington confirmed that it was absolutely correct. He also criticized mainstream media for attempting to turn Obama into a kind of idol. Why arent they discussing the facts? They think we are too stupid to understand the metrics? Denzel Washington said explaining that he had seen a segment about Obamas legacy that blew my mind and left me raging. There were more ready-and-willing workers out of the labor force than ever before by the time that guy left office. Obama blew it for America big time and now they are trying to portray him as some kind of idol? The number of people in America on food stamps more than tripled in his second term. More than tripled! Average family income went down dramatically. Home ownership rates across America went down the toilet. Obama and his cronies sold us out. Real American workers have never had less of a share of the economy. The Equalizer actor also explained that while many of his Hollywood peers were groomed by the Obamas with invitations to parties in the White House black-tie balls and barbecues on the lawn he wasnt extended the same treatment. He knew I was very suspect about him. I have always been very suspect about him. Where did he come from? What was he really doing before running for office? His history sure isnt what they say. Did he go to Columbia? Who put him in power? Addressing the reporters personally Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about Obama and his colleagues. Once upon a time this is what investigative journalists at the big newspapers would be determined to find out. Now you have all been co-opted. You defend the crooks.,,,0,0,,

The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities both in the courts and at the polls. In particular the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force. We are at this crossroads because of the Presidents deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric.

But during the actual speech Kennedy said one thing that quickly turned him into Americas biggest hypocrite. Build a wall and my generation will tear it down Kennedy stated boldly. Well hed have to start with his own estate first. Joe Kennedys Palm Beach Florida mansion now on the market has sprawling walls surrounding the property. Looks exactly like the big beautiful wall Trump wants to build around America. Now isnt that funny Kennedy owns a wall thats an ideal border wall yet trashes the president for wanting to build a wall that looks like the one Kennedy has. Can you get any more hypocritical? Even more interesting is that this estate is only six miles from President Trumps Mar-a-Lago or the Winter White House. full story Follow Us Get Updates!,,,0,0,,

Multiple media sources citing authorities on the scene report that actor Mark Salling was found dead near a Little League baseball field in Los Angeles County. Salling played the character of Puck throughout the series run. He recently plead guilty to possessing child pornography after thousands of pictures were found on a computer in his home. He was facing years in prison at an upcoming sentencing. Mark Salling has died an official with knowledge of the situation confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday. He was 35. The cause and manner of death are not clear. The Los Angeles County Coroners office could not confirm the death because the next of kin has not yet been notified. L.A. police referred all questions to the coroners office. TMZ reported that the actor died of an apparent suicide. The former Glee star had recently pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography. His sentencing was scheduled for March 7. Salling reached a plea agreement with prosecutors in October after admitting he possessed images of prepubescent children. A search warrant found more than 50000 images of child porn on his computer and a thumb drive. Salling was facing between four to seven years in prison. He would also have been required to register as a sex offender. The actor played bad boy Noah Puck Puckerman on all six seasons of Ryan Murphys musical dramedy which aired on Fox from 2009 to 2015. Law enforcement sources tell us Sallings body was found hanging from a tree. Were told police received a call to do a welfare check on Salling and somehow that led them to the baseball field where his body was found. Were told Salling had been dead for some time. Our sources say a family member came to the LAPD station at 3 AM Tuesday to report Salling as a missing person. Were told homicide detectives are on scene to rule out foul play but they say all signs point to suicide by hanging. Post your thoughts on Mark Salling in the comments section below.

Trump gave the State of the Union speech on Tuesday he did so as the president of the United States of America following instructions in the American Constitution which require him from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. Yet the State of the Union contained one word that the American Civil Liberties Union didnt like very much: America. Apparently according to the ACLU the president cant use that word if he enforces federal immigration law which is an interesting construct to this writer. Tonight President Trump said the word America more than 80 times in his speech ACLU President Faiz Shakir said in a written response to the State of the Union. Yet after a divisive first year we hear and feel how exclusionary that America is with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities. The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities both in the courts and at the polls. In particular the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force he continued. We are at this crossroads because of the Presidents deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric. We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let Americas Dreamers be deported. Mr. Shakirs speech checked off all the liberal boxes. Trump is divisive mostly because he wants to enforce immigration law and build a border wall. This idea is deeply destructive and anyone who thinks immigration law ought to be enforced is a nativist who is afraid of these young immigrants on a xenophobic level and clearly not interested in the costs and externalities of illegal immigration. Therefore they cant say America because thats deeply offensive. Unless youre part of the American Civil Liberties Union or another suitable group. Then its OK. This criticism of immigration law barely even makes sense unless you consider that it comes from a place of outrage not thought. Its outrage at the president outrage at anyone who supports them and outrage at anything they support. And if theyre for America well then America cant be good. Theyre the real Americans. This is patently ridiculous if not anti-American. But what should we expect from the ACLU? This is an organization that thinks enforcing American law is a bad thing. Its hard to be surprised under those circumstances. And yet theyre far from the only ones who believe this. If there was ever proof needed that the left has at the very least a tortured relationship with the very idea of America there you go. This is your American left ladies and gentlemen. No wonder the Democrats couldnt stand up during the State of the Union. Its not just that they dont want Trump to succeed. Theyre conflicted about whether they even want America to be successful at enforcing its own laws. Please like and share on Facebook and Twitter with your thoughts on the ACLUs statement.

The latest trend in car thievery is something thats easy to miss if you arent paying attention but its also simple to look for and prevent. Out of all of the things thieves can use to break into you car and steal your belongings coins dont seem likely to be on your list of possible options. But thats just what some criminals have begun to use according to Sun Gazing. Criminals have reportedly been using pennies and nickels to break into cars. Heres how it works: The thief jams a coin into the door handle on the cars passenger side. Then they wait for the car owner to show up and follow the owner home. When the owner tries to lock the car the mechanism fails because the passenger door handle is jammed which gives the thief the ability to enter the car through the unlocked door. Thankfully this method is easy to prevent. All you need to do it check all of your door handles for coins before you get in your car to make sure nobody is trying to break in. If you do find a coin remove it from the handle and your car will be less vulnerable. If you have discovered somebody is trying to pull this trick on you it may also be in your interest to call 911 just in case somebody has followed you home.

GlaxoSmithKline announced a Ventolin HFA 200D inhaler recall through the Asthma and Allergy Foundation (AAFA) of America on April 4 indicating that it would be a pharmacy-level recall and not one that would require consumers to turn in or exchange their inhalers. The recall came following complaints of the devices leaking. According to the complaints the leaks cause the overwrap pouches containing the inhalers to become inflated and bulge. The leaks mean that the devices may not deliver the number of doses indicated on the dose counter which could lead to incomplete dosing. Patients who do not experience a full dose may experience diminished bronchodilation during acute bronchospasm if they are relying on the rescue inhaler. The inhaler is used among asthmatics and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to deliver a metered-dose of albuterol to the airway and lungs during an asthma attack. The medication would open the airways in the lungs and allow the patient to breathe properly. Health officials labeled the recall a level II recall because it does not pose an immediate threat or danger to the health of users. While patients may experience side effects the side effects are temporary or reversible and are not considered life threatening. The likelihood of serious side effects is low. Three lots of Ventolin HFA 200D asthma inhalers in the U.S. are affected by the recall. The lot numbers include 6ZP0003 6ZP9944 and 6ZP9848. The inhalers are manufactured at a GSK plant in Zebulon North Carolina. GlaxoSmithKline is still attempting to identify the cause of the problem and plans to take corrective action. However the company is still producing the Ventolin inhalers in North Carolina. GSK also indicated there will be no impact to the asthma inhaler supply as a result of the recall. Patients can contact GlaxoSmithKline customer service at 888-825-5249 with any questions. If their asthma inhaler is failing to work and they are still experiencing symptoms they should seek medical treatment immediately.

Gregory Salcido previous Mayor previous councilman for Pico Rivera City and now a High School teacher for a History class slanders the United States Military and every soldier who ever served. Think about the people you know who are over there Your freakin stupid Uncle Louie or whatever. Theyre dumb s s. Theyre not high-level bankers. Theyre not academic people. Theyre not intellectual people. Theyre the freakin lowest of our low. The Pentagon fired back Monday at a Southern California high school teacher who was recorded apparently ranting to students that members of the military were dumb ss and not intellectual people. Pentagon spokeswoman Amber Smith said the remarks by Gregory Salcido the El Rancho High teacher whos also a Pico Rivera city councilman and former mayor were very uninformed. Before we continue with this clowns temper tantrum and mental breakdown I believe blunt truth is needed to Educate Salcido and his ilk. I find it hilarious that the 1st thing Mr. Salcido did was hide behind the 1st Amendment to defend his hate speech. According to CBS Los Angeles: Salcido could not be reached for comment but on a Facebook post stamped New York he wrote: I dont think its wise for me to make any specific comments but I want my friends family and students to know we are fine and we respect the rights of free expression for all individuals. How can he educate todays youth on American History when he obviously has no idea how America was founded and who protects his precious rights? Salcido does have the right to his own opinions and he has the right to express said opinions so long as it is done on his personal time and in such a manner that is considered legally peaceful. He does not have the right to use his classroom as his personal pulpit to attempt to indoctrinate the students on his anti-American hate speeches and his obvious hate of the United States Military and those who serve. Salcido also questioned why military recruiters were permitted to visit the school comparing them to pimps. We dont allow pimps to come into the school. The student who recorded the rant said he did so because he was angry with the teacher for what he was saying to another student who was wearing a Marine Corps sweatshirt. I was very angry It was so disrespectful to my dad and my uncles and all veterans and those still in the military. The student went on to say that his father and uncles fought in Vietnam Afghanistan and Desert Storm as United States Marines. The student recorded the Salcido from his phone which he hid under his desk because he wanted his mom to hear it but really did not intend for anyone else to hear it. I served 8 years in the Army as a Combat Medic 6 years as a civilian EMT I/D and am a husband and father. I did not go to some IVY league college life did not serve me with a silver spoon and I certainly never claim to be the smartest man in the room though my IQ is in the 120 range per the MENSA Test which I participated in a Community College classroom to take. The class just happened to be Anatomy and Physiology. I can say without a doubt that a huge part of me desires to provide Mr. Salcido with some blunt force trauma over his comments about those of us who served and those who currently do and those that gave all. However I believe the best form of education for Mr. Salcido would be for him to go and see what soldiers on the front line do and what they live on a daily. In all walks of life you have those who excel in education those who excel in street smarts and those who have a balance of both. Salcido crossed the line in his rant and made it extremely personal in his slander and then as such cowards do he screamed for protection under the 1st Amendment. I have read countless comments from civilians who are defending our Soldiers and our military as well as veterans who have very colorful feelings about Mr. Salcido. My message to Salcido is that he has his rights to express his opinions but does not have the right to do so in a classroom. Because he chose to do so in his classroom and he singled out a student he showed he is far from an educated person. His choice and his actions show a cowardly individual who lacks respect honor integrity and valor as well as humility and gratitude for his rights and opportunities that life has provided him. He does not have to like the military soldiers or the warriors ethos he does however need to respect them. If it was not for our military we would not have the rights and freedoms in the United States that provide the Democrats and scumbags to run their mouths and let stupid flow out. These ungrateful maggots that hate the military generally do so because they are cowardly little individuals that are scared of their own shadows. Individuals that lack the strength and fortitude to lace up disgraceful and filled with hate they live lives controlled by fear. I suggest if Mr. Salcido feels so strongly about his opinions and right to express his hate then man up and go confront soldiers and our military leaders and have the intestinal fortitude to say it directly to us. Stop bullying the youth and attempting to indoctrinate them with your hate and cowardly views.

In a written response to Trumps speech Faiz Shakir the ACLUs national political director said: Tonight President Trump said the word America more than 80 times in his speech. Yet after a divisive first year we hear and feel how exclusionary that America is with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities. The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities both in the courts and at the polls. In particular the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force. We are at this crossroads because of the Presidents deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric. We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let Americas Dreamers be deported. President Trump told the nation Monday night that Congress will be voting on an ""immigration reform"" package over the next few weeks and he outlined the ""four pillars"" of his ""fair compromise"" plan: The four pillars include a path to citizenship for 1.8 million dreamers if they meet education and work requirements and demostrate good moral character; a fully secure border including a wall in places and hiring more border patrol agents; an end to the random diversity visa lottery and adoption of a merit-based system; and an end to chain migration by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. (Democrats offered scattered boos to the last item.) ""These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise and one that will create a safe modern and lawful immigration system"" Trump said. ""For over 30 years Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. ""Most importantly these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together set politics aside and finally get the job done.""",,,0,0,,

A group of liberal Hollywood celebrities are threatening a massive all-round Hollywood strike unless Donald Trump resigns.

Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us not the other way around a spokesperson for the group told The New York Times. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops. Spinzon reports: Rosie ODonnell Debra Messing Ed Asner and Michael Shannon are among the dozens of artists entertainers and activists who have attached their names to an effort calling for a month-long protest to stop President-elect Donald Trump. No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America! reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. Donald Trump the President-elect is assembling a regime of grave danger the ad says. Millions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety fear and disgust. Our anguish is right and just. Our anger must now become massive resistance before Donald Trump is inaugurated and has the full reins of power in his hands. Other Hollywood celebrities who have also joined the campaign however are calling for an all-out strike that would span the entire movie industry in the hopes that such a move would urge the President-elect to resign from his position as the newly elected President of the United States.

Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us not the other way around. Asked to elaborate on why the group is targeting Hollywood out of all the industries in the country as their bargaining chip the spokesperson argued that Hollywood is simply put the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country so to speak the glue thats holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down right? Well thats exactly whats going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while were on the subject between you and me nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing but this is a necessary move. Besides its not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasnt ventured into movies in his day right? So hell understand firsthand whats going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So in effect its not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; its the people of America who are going to make him do it because the Gods honest truth is without Hollywood there is no America. Its like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront it just becomes pointless the spokesperson concluded.,,,0,0,,

Communicating in ""groundhogese"" Phil delivered the bad news: six more weeks of gloomy winter. Going all the way back to 1887 the groundhog has seen his shadow 103 times and not seen it 18 times. No record exists for the other 10 times in the late 19th century. The good news however is that the groundhog is typically wrong though his handlers get around this fact by saying Phils predictions are not necessarily geographically specific. ""There is no predictive skill for the groundhog during the most recent years of the analysis"" according to a report released this week by NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville North Carolina. Since 1988 the groundhog has predicted the weather correctly 14 times and incorrectly 16 times including last year according to USA Today. ""The fuzzy rodent saw his shadow so there should have been six more weeks of winter"" reports the outlet. ""But both February and March ended up warmer than average across the nation NOAA said. February 2017 was the second-warmest February on record."" Believe it or not Groundhog Day actually has Christian roots stemming from the European holiday of Candlemas or the Christian ""festival of lights"" on February 2. It originated with the Germans who built the tradition upon ""looking to the hedgehog as a predictor of weather the legend goes and German settlers in Pennsylvania later switched to the groundhog"" reports USA Today.

1229,https://www.goodrx.com/blog/fda-recalls-ventolin-hfa-for-asthma/,https://www.snopes.com/ventolin-safety-recall/,2018-02-06,8000.0,false,Manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline has issued a voluntary recall for Ventolin HFA a rescue inhaler used for bronchospasm (asthma). This is a class II recall the most common type of recall which means that there is a situation where the use of the recalled medication may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences but the likelihood of serious adverse effects is small. For more information on the different types of recalls see our overview here. Who can recall a drug? A manufacturer can voluntarily recall their medication or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can request or require that a manufacturer recall a particular medication. In this case the manufacturer has voluntarily recalled Ventolin HFA with the knowledge of the FDA. Why was Ventolin HFA recalled? Defective Ventolin HFA inhalers have been found to have a possible leakage in the canister. This can cause the inhaler to administer fewer doses of medication than it should. At this time there have not been any adverse events reported and the defect doesnt pose a serious health risk to the patient. However since the canister is releasing fewer doses this may cause patients to run out of medication and need a refill sooner than expected. Which products were recalled? The 3 affected lots were shipped between January 4th 2017 and February 6th 2017 to retail pharmacies and wholesale distributors throughout the United States. This recall will affect the following: Drug: Ventolin HFA 200 actuation inhaler. Ventolin HFA 200 actuation inhaler. Manufacturer: GlaxoSmithKline GlaxoSmithKline Lots: 6ZP0003 (Expiration date: April 2018) 6ZP9944 (Expiration date: April 2018). 6ZP9848 (Expiration date: March 2018) 6ZP0003 (Expiration date: April 2018) 6ZP9944 (Expiration date: April 2018). 6ZP9848 (Expiration date: March 2018) National Drug Code: 00173-0682-20 Are there any other products similar to Ventolin HFA? Yes. Ventolin HFA is a rescue inhaler that contains albuterol. Several other companies make similar inhalers like ProAir HFA ProAir Respiclick Proventil HFA. What should I do if I have an affected lot? If you think you have the recalled Ventolin HFA product contact your pharmacy immediately. You can also contact GlaxoSmithKline the manufacturer of Ventolin HFA by calling 1-888-825-5249. If you ever notice that your medication looks different than your previous fill ask your pharmacist. In rare instances such as this drug recall manufacturers and their processes fail. Contacting the manufacturer and/or letting your pharmacist know is important so that these types of incidents can be properly reported. Dont miss out on savings!

1230,https://www.healthnutnews.com/fda-declares-homeopathic-drugs-illegal/,https://www.snopes.com/homeopathic-drugs-now-illegal/,2018-02-01,2000.0,false,By Dr. Mercola About 5 million U.S. adults and 1 million U.S. children use homeopathy every year and the remedies are known to be generally safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions according to the U.S. National Institutes of Healths National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Yet if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues on its latest crusade this natural health modality may soon be much harder to come by. RELATED STORY: In a draft guidance document released in December 2017 the FDA takes aim at homeopathic remedies or as they put it drug products labeled as homeopathic. In a reversal of a long-standing decision to treat homeopathic remedies differently from other drugs the FDA has now labeled virtually all of these products as new drugs that are subject to FDA enforcement action at any time. FDA Declares Homeopathic Drugs Illegal Plans to Ramp Up Enforcement Actions While deaths from drugs like opioids are now a public health crisis homeopathy has maintained a much lower and presumably safer profile. Yet the FDA is using its limited resources to target the latter citing a need to protect consumers who choose to use homeopathic products. Why now? The FDA also cited a large uptick in products labeled as homeopathic that are being marketed for a wide array of diseases and conditions to the extent that homeopathic products are now a close to $3 billion industry. RELATED STORY: Perhaps thats $3 billion too much for Big Pharma FDAs cozy partner in crime. [I]n one fell swoop the FDA has declared that virtually every single homeopathic drug on the market is being sold illegally the Alliance for Natural Health USA (ANH USA) wrote and its not an exaggeration. In essence the FDAs guidance reads: Any homeopathic drug that has not been considered generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/E) is considered a new drug FDA has not determined that any homeopathic drugs are GRAS/E A new drug cannot be marketed unless it goes through the FDAs approval process No homeopathic drugs have gone through FDA approval nor can any producer afford to take them through the approval process The FDA then states that its proposing a new risk-based enforcement approach and first plans to target the unapproved drug products labeled as homeopathic that have the greatest potential to cause risk to patients. This includes: Products with reported safety concerns Products that contain or claim to contain ingredients associated with potentially significant safety concerns Products for routes of administration other than oral and topical Products intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of serious and/or life-threatening diseases and conditions Products for vulnerable populations Products that do not meet standards of quality strength or purity as required under the law FDA Does About-Face Penalizes an Entire Industry The draft guidance is a complete turnaround from the FDAs prior stance on homeopathic remedies which stated under the 1988 Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 400.400 Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed they did not need to get FDA approval prior to coming on the market. Instead the ingredients in homeopathic remedies were to be verified by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS). As noted by law firm Venable: Essentially the HPUS creates a monograph for homeopathic drugs to follow not dissimilar to the OTC drug monographs that FDA has developed for allopathic drugs. Accordingly by virtue of an ingredients inclusion in the HPUS the ingredient has already been closely examined and determined to be safe and effective by the HPCUS [Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention of the United States]. Compliance with the HPUS functions as a premarket review of safety and effectiveness in the homeopathic context. By classifying homeopathic drugs as unapproved new drugs the FDA is requiring a second showing of safety and effectiveness a step that is unnecessary not to mention impractical given that the Agency intends to hold homeopathic products to an allopathic standard that is inappropriate given the nature of homeopathic products. Further it was by the FDAs own deliberate decision that homeopathic drugs were excluded from former drug approval processes and intended to be a separate category. Venable continued: The FDA deliberately excluded homeopathic drugs from both the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) review (the process by which all drugs approved between 1938 and 1962 were retrospectively evaluated by the FDA for effectiveness) and the OTC Drug Review in 1972 (the process used to develop OTC drug monographs for allopathic drugs) deciding instead in the latter case to regulate homeopathic products separately because of their uniqueness. By withdrawing the CPG and classifying all homeopathic drugs as unapproved drugs subject to FDA drug approval the FDA is now requiring higher regulatory thresholds for OTC homeopathic drugs than are applicable to allopathic OTC drugs many of which are permitted to be sold pursuant to the FDA monograph system. This move in effect penalizes an entire industry for the Agencys 1972 decision. FTC Targeted Homeopathy in 2016 The FDA isnt the first government agency to target this centuries old natural medicine system. In a notice filed in November 2016 the FTC stated that in order for homeopathic remedies to claim they are effective their makers must provide proof. If no proof is provided the remedies must state there is no scientific evidence that the product works. In order to not mislead consumers the FTC further stated that homeopathic remedies lacking sufficient proof must communicate to consumers that the products claims are based only on theories of homeopathy from the 1700s that are not accepted by most modern medical experts. Dana Ullman MPH CCH one of the leading advocates for homeopathy in the U.S. said at the time: Considering the longtime safety history of homeopathic medicines it is surprising and even shocking that the FTC would consider proposing new regulations now. One cannot help but wonder who or what is pulling their strings policies commonly result from powerful economic forces at play it is clear that this governmental agency is ignoring important scientific evidence and one must wonder if they are protecting Big Pharma from competition more than protecting the consumer. Does Homeopathy Work? Based on the theory that like cures like or the Law of Similars homeopathy was founded by German physician Dr. Samuel Hahnemann. The idea is that health conditions can be healed by treating a person with minute doses of a substance that would produce similar symptoms to their health condition if given in larger doses. Homeopathys other guiding principle is that of the minimum dose which is based on the premise that the more a substance is diluted the more potent homeopathic remedy it becomes known as the law of infinitesimals. Homeopathic remedies may be made from plants minerals or other substances and are commonly administered in pellet form dissolved under the tongue. A number of intriguing studies suggest homeopathy is effective and safe for a variety of ailments including flu. According to Ullman: The use of a homeopathic medicine called Oscillococcinum is an example of a remedy that can be effective for many people with the flu though clinical experience suggests that it is most effective when used within 48 hours of getting flu symptoms. Although most homeopathic medicines are made from the plant or mineral kingdom Oscillococcinum is unusual in that it is made from the heart and liver of a duck. In one study nearly twice as many patients who were given Oscillococcinum recovered from the flu within 48 hours as those given a placebo. Further Ullman noted: A different group of researchers conducted a randomized double-blind study involving 372 patients (188 treated with Oscillococcinum and 187 with placebo) of both sexes ranging in age from 12 to 60 who presented rectal temperature 100.4 F muscle pains headache or at least one of the following symptoms: shivering chest pain spine pain coughing irritation of nasal mucosa or feeling of malaise. Patients received three tubes of Oscillococcinum or placebo each day (morning noon and night) for three days. The results of this trial show a highly statistically significant difference between the two groups for what concerns disappearance of symptoms after 48 hours (19.2 percent in the Oscillococcinum group versus 17.1 percent in the placebo group) and improvement in symptoms (43.7 percent versus 38.6 percent for placebo). Additional research shows homeopathys promising role in the following conditions: In patients with allergies those using homeopathy reported improvements in nasal airflow compared with a placebo group. With homeopathic treatment the researchers described a clear significant and clinically relevant improvement in nasal inspiratory peak flow similar to that found with topical steroids. Homeopathy significantly reduced the severity and duration of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis (swelling and sores in the mouth) in children. Homeopathic medicine was effective in treating acute childhood diarrhea decreasing both the duration of the diarrhea and the number of stools per day. Homeopathy has positive effects in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) particularly in the areas of behavioral and cognitive functions. Homeopathy lessened tender point pain and improved quality of life in people with fibromyalgia. Homeopathic was effective in treating the early stages of vitiligo in a report of 14 cases FDA Continues to Crack Down on Natural Substances Protect Big Pharma The FDAs new push to regulate homeopathic products is eerily reminiscent of their recent crackdown on the plant kratom. Leaves from the kratom tree have been used for pain relief for hundreds of years but scientists now know they contain compounds that target the brain similarly to opioids helping to relieve pain. It appears the plant may be safer than opioids for pain relief and could even act as a tool to help those suffering from opioid withdrawal. RELATED STORY: In November 2017 however rather than targeting the prescription opioids that are the root of the opioid epidemic the FDA issued a public health advisory regarding risks associated with kratom use suggesting that its usage could expand the opioid epidemic. What this comes down to for some is the right to choose what form of medicine to put in your body. As Dr. Lee Hieb an orthopedic surgeon and past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons wrote in WND: Im not here to tout any particular over-the-counter remedy but who gave the FDA total ability to limit what we can take into our bodies while virtually forcing us to be given what they prescribe? Its none of their business whether a homeopathic remedy is worthless. Thats an issue of commerce and truth in advertising. I for one want the freedom to research and decide for myself what supplements to take even if my supplements ultimately do me no good. (Many do a great deal of good as Big Pharma knows only too well.) People have the right to choose their treatment and doctors (many of whom admit to prescribing placebos to their patients) also retain the right to offer treatments they deem useful whether it be homeopathy or another remedy. As for the FDAs new draft guidance on homeopathic drugs its attempting to discredit such remedies proven healing powers before their mechanisms of action have even been fully understood. If you want to express your opinion on the matter the FDA is accepting comments from the public until March 30 2018. *Article originally appeared at Mercola.,,,0,0,,
1231,https://www.inquisitr.com/4764083/homeopathic-drugs-illegal-fda-declares-virtually-all-natural-medicines-as-new-drugs-being-sold-illegally/,https://www.snopes.com/homeopathic-drugs-now-illegal/,2018-02-01,2000.0,false,The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reportedly declared that virtually all homeopathic drugs are illegal. Reports that the FDA is cracking down on the use of natural medicines have been circulating for a while. However in a recently released guidance document the FDA is now quoted as saying that homeopathic drugs are considered new drugs that are allegedly being sold illegally. The FDA released its new guidance document last month and sources in support of the use of homeopathic drugs are still attempting to translate what the FDA is calling a draft guidance thats been released for comment purposes only. Homeopathy is becoming an increasingly popular form of treating various diseases naturally for people worldwide. According to the Homeopathy Research Institute more than 200 million people now regularly use homeopathic drugs with over 6 million people in the U.S. alone using homeopathy for self-care of specific health conditions. More and more people are turning to homeopathic drugs versus prescriptions drugs due to alleged lower cost and fewer side effects. Natural medicines are also said to heal rather than simply mask the symptoms of a disease. With a growing number of the adult population around the world turning to homeopathy as well as the recent war on opioids in the news the FDA decided to announce new policies on the use of homeopathic drugs. An article on the Alliance for Natural Health USA from just over two weeks ago states that the FDA has effectively labeled virtually every single homeopathic drug as illegal as outlined in the homeopathic guidance document. In an attempt to decode the FDAs current position on the use and sale of homeopathic drugs the previously mentioned article says that since not one homeopathic drug has yet to be approved by the FDA as being safe and effective then all homeopathic drugs are effectively illegal and therefore currently being sold illegally. A new drug cannot be marketed unless it goes through the FDAs approval process. No homeopathic drugs have gone through FDA approval nor can any producer afford to take them through the approval process. Citing the guidance document on the FDA website homeopathic drugs are marketed unapproved new drugs with potential safety risks and lack evidence of effectiveness. The document goes on to say that homeopathic drugs are considered health fraud products which in turn present challenges in getting the FDAs approval as new drugs. The FDA then goes on to outline a risk-based approach to regulating homeopathic drugs. An article on Mercola from Tuesday states that both adults and children currently use homeopathic drugs because natural medicines are still considered generally safe. Unlike some prescription medications homeopathic remedies are also said to not carry the same risk of dependency and according to Mercola are unlikely to cause severe side effects. However as noted on Mercola the FDA still plans to take a new approach of regulating homeopathic drugs that reportedly carry a greater risk to patients. After essentially determining that homeopathic drugs are new drugs that havent been approved for manufacturing distributing or marketing the FDA notes that it plans to enforce regulatory actions against certain categories of homeopathic drugs. Those categories include homeopathic drugs with already reported safety concerns homeopathic drugs with ingredients that are determined to raise safety concerns including products that contain multiple homeopathic ingredients homeopathic drugs that are not for use orally or topically as well as homeopathic products that claim to prevent or treat serious or life-threatening health conditions. FDA takes more aggressive stance toward homeopathic drugs https://t.co/gMGceJN9S6 Ohio Pharmacists (@OhioPharmacists) January 19 2018 However SmithsonianMag reported in November of 2016 that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had already announced a policy that requires a disclaimer on homeopathic drugs that state there is no scientific evidence to prove that homeopathy really works to treat illness and disease. The article on SmithsonianMag goes on to clarify that the FDA did not yet police homeopathic drugs and remedies. With the FDA recently joining the FTC in regulating the use of homeopathy while basically stating that all homeopathic drugs are illegal and unapproved new drugs supporters of natural medicine are speaking out. There are several petitions circulating online in support of legalizing all homeopathy and other supporters are simply speaking their minds on social media and in forums and message boards. Gizmodo notes that the FDA is taking comments on the new guidance document for 90 days from its release date in December before deciding on regulations and enforcement policies for illegal homeopathic drugs. Comments on Gizmodo are mixed from some supporters of homeopathy saying that people have died from doctor-prescribed medications to critics saying that there are only a very few homeopathic drugs that actually work. Patients who turn to homeopathy to treat health conditions often become fed up with conventional medical treatments and the Huffington Post reported that a high percentage of homeopathic users in India would not switch to conventional treatments while even physicians around the world are increasingly turning to homeopathic drugs as alternative treatments. When asked if homeopathic drugs are going to be removed from the market the FDA clarifies on its website that top concern is patient safety.,,,0,0,,

In Germany he does not lift a finger. He lives on social welfare paid by German taxpayers. And he does so with his four wives and 22 children. He also has an adult daughter who is married in Saudi Arabia. So it would be interesting to see how much he would earn if he was in the USA and we all know how many cases of Muslims coming into our country and living on welfare! A U.S. economist has calculated how much this family would take from the U.S. Treasury. He reached a figure that it is about $ 360000 a year. Yet vets struggle every day. Not to mention hard working people who live payday to payday. That figure has led many Americans to see red at the fact that they are the ones who must pay the large sum. Money to healthy adults who do not work and even undermines American values with polygamy. In Muslim countries a man is usually allowed to have up to four wives. Ghazia A. is one of the many Muslim men who has used this right in Syria. In the United States and most of the western countries however polygamy is prohibited. But immigration means that there is a growing number of Muslims in the United States who practice polygamy. Ghazia A. admittedly was asked to make one of the four wives his official wife and he chose Twasif with five children as his official wife. The three other women now live three other places with the other 17 children. But in reality his polygamy remains largely unchanged !

Well hed have to start with his own estate first. Joe Kennedys Palm Beach Florida mansion now on the market has sprawling walls surrounding the property.

Its unclear if these walls and border protections were morally reprehensible in the eyes of the 37-year-old Kennedy. He also added We choose the thousands of American communities whose roads arent paved with power and privilege but with honest effort good faith and the resolve to build something better for their kids.

Gutierrez made headlines after the amnesty-loving lawmaker called Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly a disgrace to the uniform. Fox News reports: In an email to Fox News late Sunday Kelly responded by saying Congress did nothing to help so-called Dreamers when they had the chance. As far as the congressman and other irresponsible members of congress are concerned they have the luxury of saying what they want as they do nothing and have almost no responsibility Kelly said. They can call people liars but it would be inappropriate for me to say the same thing back at them. As my blessed mother used to say empty barrels make the most noise.

Gutierrez a well-known immigration advocate defended the protest shortly before his arrest.

The ACLU issued a statement after President Donald Trumps speech on Tuesday night a speech that was noted for its bipartisan nature. But to the ACLU saying ""America"" was a triggering moment it seems. ""Tonight President Trump said the word America more than 80 times in his speech. Yet after a divisive first year we hear and feel how exclusionary that America is with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities"" said the statement from ACLU national political director Faiz Shakir. For anyone who doubts the leftist tilt of the ACLU a review of Shakirs resume will show in which direction their politics lean. Before joining the group that claims to simply stand for individual liberties under the Constitution Shakir was a top aide to Democratic Senator Harry Reid. Prior to joining Reids office he worked for Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and before that the Center for American Progress helping lead their far left publication Think Progress. Shakir and the ACLU are not only upset with President Trump for using the word ""America"" in his speech but also for defending America against illegal immigration. According to the ACLU statement the group will fight against the presidents stated immigration plan which offered citizenship for so-called ""Dreamers"" in exchange for securing the border and fixing the system. Shakir promised that the ACLU would fight the president. ""In particular the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force"" Shakir said. While the ACLU scaremongers about mass deportations President Trump offered something different in his speech: ""The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age -- that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration"" the president said. The rest of the presidents plan includes securing the border with the construction of the border wall replacing the visa lottery system with a merit-based immigration plan and ending chain migration by restricting sponsorship to immediate family members.",,,0,0,,

From NY Post: She loves the college life just not the classes. Hunter Collegeis waging a court battle to evict a stubborn student who refuses to leave her dorm room some two years after dropping out. Delaware native Lisa S. Palmer who has not paid rent since 2016 refuses to leave Room E579 at the schools 425 E. 25th St. co-ed dormitory according to an eviction lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. The 32-year-old racked up a staggering $94000 in unpaid residence hall charges on account of her continued occupancy all the while ignoring Hunter Colleges service of additional vacate notices said the suit. As of today June 7 2016 you are still in occupancy of the aforementioned room Michell Quock assistant director of residence life wrote to Palmer two summers ago. Last fall a Hunter attorney continued the battle to get rid of Palmer sending her an eviction notice that said in bold-faced type: THIRTY DAY NOTICE OF TERMINATION. You are required to vacate and surrender the premises on or before Oct. 31 2017 at 12:00 p.m. the attorney wrote. But the former geography major who now works for an architecture firm refused to budge. I plan on fighting the lawsuit and while I fight it Im going to stay Palmer told The Post from outside her messy 100-square-foot single which is adorned with a lava lamp a dream catcher and piles of dirty dishes. Though school officials say Palmer dropped out she insists Hunter refused to let her register for fall 2016 classes after she disputed her housing and tuition bill. I felt that it was a miscommunication initially but after I met with the dean I felt that they were starting to treat me unfairly. It was like Get out she said. Only full-time students who maintain a minimum grade point average and keep current on their room and board fees can stay in the dorms the suit says. Palmer who first enrolled in Hunter in 2010 after a stint at St. Johns University in Queens said dorm life is really lonely for someone in her 30s. I feel very isolated she said noting that Hunter moved her to a wing thats only occupied by a middle-aged nurse whom the college is also trying to evict. The college wants to boot a total of nine nurses who were given rooms in various wings of the E. 25th Street building when it was owned by Bellevue Hospital. The resident nurses include 67-year-old Derek DeFreitas who kept a dormitory room crash pad at the address for decades. DCG,,"81rbzo,",1,0,"IWB,","jamesbond1211,"

Declaring to his 40.2 million Twitter followers at 7:03am Trump announced Justin Trudeau has just tweeted Happy Thanksgiving in the middle of October adding this has to be the dumbest tweet in history. Idiot! BREAKING: Trump Claims He Witnessed Numerous Sexual Assaults By High Profile TV Exec Who Now Works In Politics The outburst was later deleted but not before being retweeted 250000 times and was quickly followed by: He just tweets things that everyone knows are so stupid Trump continued citing the time Trudeau celebrated Independence Day 3 days early. Canadians are completely regretting electing him now. The man seriously needs to think before he types. Hes the face of an entire nation for goddamn sake. Doesnt someone check his tweets? he added before quickly turning his attention to all of Canada. AND CANADA If youre so eager to get an early start why dont you just get your own Thanksgiving? Trump wrote about the North American holiday which actually originated in Canada in 1578. Canadian Thanksgiving or as its known in Canada Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October and led to the hashtags HappyThanksgiving and CanadianThanksgiving to trending on social media. Predictably this caused President Trump a great deal of confusion and ultimately anger. Why is everyone tweeting about Thanksgiving? was soon followed up with: Justin Trudeau and the liberal elites are trying to steal Thanksgiving and make it Canadian.

The organization advocates against violence and racism towards black people in society. Not that long ago the liberal media pushed an inspiring story of a homeless black woman who became one of the leading figures in the movement and was an important member of Black Lives Matter organizing over 900 events and gather millions of dollars in donations which were allegedly for a good cause. These donations were supposed to help raise black men and women up in society. However newest revelations suggest that Marquesha Johnson was not the humanitarian everybody thought she was. In fact the donations she collected helped only herself to rise in society. A class action lawsuit stated that Johnson had solicited donations from vulnerable people to help others but instead used it to help herself. According to the document the Black Lives Matter leading figure purchased a $1.2 million home for herself. But this is not all instead of using the donations to help people she also bought herself a brand new Range rover as well as some other exorbitancies. Nevertheless sadly she will get away with it because its most likely that the way she did it was perfectly legal. Namely she used the GoFundMe campaign to ask for the funds and reportedly the company is particularly bad at working with police to crack down on scammers. Allegedly Marquesha Johnson was interrogated by the police but she denied all accusations about misusing the funds and she refused to submit any records. She used the company platform in order to fill her pockets with money that werent hers to take. This is more than just bad publicity for Black Lives Matter to have someone like this in their leading circles while blacks across America continue to suffer poverty and gang culture.,,,0,0,,
